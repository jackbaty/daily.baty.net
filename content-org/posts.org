Today, I shall {{{mark(improve something)}}}. It doesn't matter what that something is.

I am considering some form of {{{mark(internet hiatus)}}}. Social media, mainly. We all suspect it's not healthy, but I'm still addicted and feel like a break would do me good. Can I manage to only post on the blogs and only read my (fairly limited) set of RSS feeds? Is that enough?

How many of the super-cool things I can do with Org mode are actually useful and not just super-cool things that I think are super-cool?

I wonder if this is related to the USB ports not working on my LG display? [[https://www.macrumors.com/2022/03/24/external-display-issues-reported-macos-12-3/][Users Report External Monitor Issues After Updating to macOS Monterey 12.3 - MacRumors]]. I don't think so.

Good morning. It's 4:25 am and I should probably be doing something useful today, but so far it doesn't look like that's going to happen.

So, I replaced [[https://baty.net][baty.net]] with a {{{mark(Hugo-based version)}}} of the blog. All the content from the WordPress site has been migrated. Well, /most/ of it. Some formatting got all blowed up. This is why I swore I'd never do it again, but here we are. I just got tired of pushing up against all the /stuff/ that is WordPress. *(18 hours later)* . I just switched DNS back and forth twice today. I honestly don't know which site I want to use.

I'm feeling the {{{mark(weight of WordPress)}}} pushing against the inconvenience of maintaining a static blog. The past couple of days, I have found myself happier dealing with the inconvenience. So, I've rebuilt all of baty.net using Hugo. Content has been imported and it's ready to go. All I need to do is sync it up to a virtual host on my VPS and update the DNS. But, I'm going to sit on this a bit to see how I feel. I'd hate for it to just have been my mood this morning.

I read the headlines from the Grammys and didn't recognize any of the performers mentioned. I'm old and I guess I can officially stop caring about the Grammys.

I just happened to already be in Emacs so I thought I'd {{{mark(write here for a spell)}}}. It's no joke üòâ. Which reminds me that today is the best day to stay off the internet.

I've been publishing a few of the notes from my Org-roam database over at [[https://notes.baty.net][notes.baty.net]] just in case they might be useful to someone somewhere. I also like to browse them as decent-looking (read-only) HTML files instead of from within Emacs all the time. I'm using a version of the same "CodeIt" theme I used to use for baty.net. Ideally I'd list the categories on the home page rather than a list of recent posts, but Hugo's templating system is completely unfathomable to me so I'm leaving it alone for now. Another thing I'm doing "wrong" is putting the theme's git repo right in the themes folder. No submodules, no hugo modules. I'm just editing in place. Hell, I might just stop keeping it as a separate repo :).

After I don't even know how many years, I've {{{mark(canceled my Dropbox account)}}}

I thought I'd lost my {{{mark(entire archive of posts)}}} from the [[https://archive.baty.net][original baty.net]]  but accidentally ran into it [[https://github.com/jackbaty/archive.baty.net][on Github]] yesterday. Whew!

Don't tell anyone, but I'm thinking about {{{mark(selling the M10-R)}}} again. That would put me at a 4-month period of buying and selling two of them. I just can't get over feeling guilty about having so much money tied up in a camera that I'm hardly using. It worries me that something could go wrong with it or it would get broken or stolen and I'd be out all that money. I don't like feeling this way. Still noodling on it.

So far this morning I've written notes in Emacs, Roam, TiddlyWiki, and Logseq. JFC what's wrong with me? This is after spending a good part of the last few days dialing in my Emacs config for capturing, writing, publishing, etc. UWYH (Use What You Have), remember? I do, but I /have/ everything.

All of our smoke detectors started chirping at the same time last night. No smoke or fire. After an hour of walking around with that ear-piercing shrill, we noticed water coming out of one of the detectors in the basement. The one directly below the kitchen sink. {{{mark(Leaky garbage disposal)}}}. I removed the detector, which had shorted out (causing the ruckus). Turned off the water supply to the sink, and went to bed. Today is garbage disposal replacement day.

The conflict for me happens when I can't decide if it matters to me {{{mark(how things are done)}}}. For example, film photographs mean more to me than digital photographs, so I tend to prefer using film because of /how/ the photos are made. Otherwise, digital gets the job done and is 1,000% easier. Similarly, using Emacs for notes and tasks and blogging is, for me, the correct way to handle things. Plain text, consistent environment, free and open source. On the other hand, using Things and DEVONthink and WordPress sure is pretty and easy.

I {{{mark(updated this site's RSS feed)}}} to only include type "post". By default everything is included and this meant things like the About page were in the RSS feed.

I used to love programming and computers because I could make them /do/ things. I still probably could, but I no longer know what I want them to do.

My tendency to write daily posts {{{mark(here vs the wiki)}}} is tied to how deep I am into Emacs at the moment. Right now... that's /very deep/.


I've spent hours configuring my [[https://www.orgroam.com][Org-roam]] setup so I can {{{mark(publish certain notes as a website)}}}. It's so cool, but in the end I'm not sure it offers clear advantages over the wiki other than that I can make some of my roam notes public without needing to rewrite them in TiddlyWiki. WIP is here: notes.baty.net. *Later*: now I've realized that I can simply add some [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co][ox-hugo]] metadata to any of my Org files and have them publish to this daily notes blog. Like so...

Writing in Emacs is great. Static websites are great. Using Emacs to manage and deal with content for a static website exhausts me eventually. Doesn't bode well for this site, although it's probably just my mood today.

I follow [[https://flickr.com/photos/32681588@N03/][Matt Osbourne]] (aka Mr. Leica) on Flickr because he plays with just about every combination of lens and camera you could think of. Also, the lovely models don't hurt. Thing is, with all the fuss about camera/lens combinations, all {{{mark(the images look basically the same)}}}. The biggest difference is film vs digital but otherwise I'd be hard-pressed to tell one from the other.

You can see below that I'm experimenting with {{{mark(subheadings within daily posts)}}}. This is for things that are more than one paragraph of text or text and images. There's a way to copy a link to the heading, but it only makes sense on an individual day's page. Not sure if I'll find it useful, but let's try it.

Good morning. It's 4:03 am and I'm already at my desk. Why?

Something {{{mark(cool about Emacs)}}} that I tend to forget about is putting code right in my notes and executing it from there. I don't have to remember commands or switches, because they're right there. I just hit C-c C-c and the command's output is rendered right in the file .

It's cool that I [[https://baty.net/2022/domain-consolidation-continued/][consolidated a bunch of blogs]] and reorganized my domain names. That meant I could be down to just a couple (few?) sites. Except I don't enjoy writing in TiddlyWiki nearly as much as I do in Emacs. And this blog looks a lot better than [[https://rl.baty.net][the wiki]], so I switched.

I'm going to try setting up the [[https://rl.baty.net/#Leitz%20Focomat%20IIc][Focomat IIc]] today. It's been in storage for a couple of years. I never did get the longer lens mounted properly, so it's 35mm only for now. I'm hoping I can fit both the IIc and the V35 in at the same time. I'd like to do some side-by-side (condensor vs diffusor head) comparisons. And then eventually figure out the problem with the longer lens so I can also make prints from the Hasselblad (6x6) negatives.

This looks nice for timelines: [[https://github.com/kochrt/cascade.page][kochrt/cascade.page: Make a cascading timeline from markdown-like text.]]

You may have noticed that I've been posting daily notes both here and on [[https://rudimentarylathe.wiki][the wiki]]. This is because I like writing in both places and I can't find a path to choosing one of them. The wiki is just so easy and I like that it's right next to most of my other notes. When I don't write here regularly, the rest of the information languishes. It loses its "wikiness". On the other hand, with baty.blog I get to write in Emacs using Org-mode and publish a good-looking "normal" blog with RSS feeds and archives and all the other things that I love about blogs. I think that TiddlyWiki is the best long-term answer, but Hugo is what I prefer living with today. Still noodlin' on it. You may also have noticed that I've cross-posted this in both places. Sigh.

Weird day. {{{mark(The Leica SL2-S is for sale and I ordered an M10-R)}}} (again). Yes, I know, I just got rid of an M10-R a month ago. What can I say, I missed it. I've also decided to focus my energy (and $$$) around the M system. Supporting two different systems was expensive and kind of exhausting. The problem is that just putting the SL2-S in the box makes me want to keep it. Still for sale, though.

I continue to enjoy Leica's M cameras because they are wildly uncomplicated. Unlike everything else:

Darktable can't deal with the Q2 Monochrom...no lens correction. It /needs/ lens correction. Unless I'm missing something, this is a deal-breaker.

I plugged in the Mac yesterday so I could actually enjoy working with photos. What I'm finding is that I, again, miss using i3 and workspaces the way they're set up in Regolith. I've been trying some combinations of Rectangle and Divvy and Better Touch Tool to see what I can get, but nothing works as smoothly and consistently. I'm about to plug in the ThinkPad for the day. Weird.

OK, there. Back on Linux. It feels good, but at the same time, feels janky. Linux /thinks/ right, but the implementation is often spotty. So help me if I can't figure out how to consistently copy and paste between Emacs, a terminal, and the rest of the system, I'll throw the whole thing out a window.

I've been tinkering with ideas for my next career, and re-learning Ruby on Rails was on the short list.

I've long admired [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Heinemeier_Hansson][DHH]] and [[https://rubyonrails.org][Rails]] and Basecamp (the [[https://basecamp.com/about][company]] and the [[https://basecamp.com/][product]]). I shipped my first Rails app in 2007. I envied the way they ran the company and how open they were about it. I lapped up all their books. I even agreed with the way they handled the whole "no political discussions" fiasco. I used to feel like he, although cocky and arrogant, was right more than he was wrong about most things.

But after reading [[https://world.hey.com/dhh][DHH's newsletter]] lately, I think I'm out.

His latest, [[https://world.hey.com/dhh/spotify-must-be-afraid-of-canceling-rogan-right-right-8fc9f1f6][Spotify must be afraid of canceling Rogan, right? Right?!]], was the final straw for me. It wasn't just the inane title, but that he keeps showing that he doesn't understand the argument and insisting that "both-sides"-ism is always OK.

Neal Young doesn't want to share a platform with Rogan. Not because Rogan "hosts guests with divergent views" because he hosts guests with demonstrably incorrect and dangerous views...and seems to agree with them. DHH apparently doesn't understand science, either. Not really.

Anyway, I don't want to argue with him. And I don't want to argue /about/ him. But, he makes me want to /not/ use his products. Which is a shame because I think Rails is still a valid, viable, and valuable option. I just wanted to vent a little about my disappointment with someone who used to inspire me.

Maybe he'll calm down and get over this latest mood, or at least stop writing so much while feeling the way he seems to feel. I hope so.

There is a nicely-configured [[https://system76.com/desktops/thelio-mira][Thelio Mira]] in my shopping cart. I came close to pulling the trigger yesterday, but a clear head prevailed. So far. I know me. In 2 weeks I'll be back on my Mac and the old ThinkPad I'm typing this on will be packed up and in the closet until next time I get the Linux itch. My thinking with the Thelio is that in order to get the full Linux experience, I should work on a faster, modern machine. There could be something to that, but mostly it's just an excuse to buy a new toy. I'm going to sit on it for a month or two and if I still think I could switch to Linux, I'll buy something nice to run it on.

Suddenly, Emacs is running slowly on the ThinkPad. Could it be that I need a faster machine?

Back on Linux this morning. I missed i3 yesterday. So far, as long as I'm not doing photo-related stuff, Regolith is working great.

Good morning!

[[/img/2022/20220126-L1010053.jpg]]

I've decided to {{{mark(work on my Mac today)}}}, after a few days on Linux. Apple people tend to complain a lot about the sorry state of macOS, but coming back after time away is a stark reminder of the sheer level of refinement in macOS. It's just...nice.

The [[https://system76.com/desktops/thelio-mira][Thelio Mira]] from System76 is tempting. I'd like to try a modern, powerful desktop machine running Linux. I mean, how else can I do a fair comparison with my MBP? üòú. So far I've avoided the temptation, because, I just bought a top-spec'd MacBook Pro, remember? If it weren't for wanting to edit photos with good software, I'd be much more tempted.

Living down a rabbit hole of photo editing processes, techniques, and software does nothing to improve my photography, so I'm backing off a bit and putting everything in {{{mark(baby Lightroom)}}} for a while.

I've changed tagging for financially-related items in my {{{mark(Org daybook)}}} to ":money:" because I'm tired of trying to decide/remember between :finances:, :finance:, and :financial:. Now it's just :money:

Just for fun, and as a fallback for 1Password, I've started using [[https://www.passwordstore.org/][Pass: The Standard Unix Password Manager]] again. It's been years. I started with a fresh .password-store/ and will fill it as needed.

I've been experimenting with adding highlights to text in my daily posts. The idea is that it makes scanning easier. I pick out the important parts of each entry and add a =<mark>= HTML tag. Then I style the region like so:

#+begin_src css
mark {
  background: rgba(255, 255, 0, 0.3);
}
#+end_src

Recently, there's been a {{{mark(change in org that broke my markup)}}} when exporting from ox-hugo. Here's the comment by [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi][kaushalmodi]]:

[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/540][Issue #540]]
#+begin_quote
This was a recent breaking change that fixed an inconsistency in ox-hugo (compared to ox-html). If we want to export verbatim HTML, it needs to be in @@html:..@@ or in an HTML export block
#+end_quote

His suggestion to use a macro was excellent, so I did that. At the top of my posts.org file, is this:

=#+macro: mark @@html:<mark>$1</mark>@@=

When I want to =<mark>= some text, I add the macro inline, like so:

=I would like to {{{mark(mark this text)}}} so that it is highlighted=

But who has time to add all that markup by hand? To make it easier, I created the following function:

#+begin_src lisp
(defun jab/markregion ()
  "Add a 'mark' macro to the current region (for Hugo)"
  (interactive)
  (if (region-active-p)
      (progn
        (goto-char (region-end))
        (insert ")}}}")
        (goto-char (region-beginning))
        (insert "{{{mark("))))
#+end_src

Now, I select a region and run =M-x jab/markregion=. I may create a keybinding for it, too, but for now this is fast and easy.

Installed the [[https://github.com/ibnishak/Timimi][Timimi plugin]] for Firefox again on the ThinkPad. I've not been using [[https://rudimentarylathe.wiki][the wiki]] for daily notes, but I do like having it for, well, a wiki. Since I'm using Firefox on Linux,  {{{mark(Timimi is the simplest option)}}} for saving TiddlyWiki files.

I moved a lot of my synced files on the Mac {{{mark(out of iCloud Files)}}}.
This was mainly due to wanting them available on Linux, but also because iCloud
has been flaky lately. I'm always surprised how well [[https://syncthing.net/][Syncthing]] works, and how
easy it is to install. Previously, I'd configured it once and it ran and ran and
I'd forget it was there. You know, like Dropbox used to. So far, this time it
was even easier to set up and has been running without issue.

I'm thinking I'll reserve using [[https://jack.micro.blog][my micro.blog]] for posting images. Mostly.

Pretty happy with [[https://www.orgroam.com/][Org-roam]]. Every day I get closer to calling it and living there for my notes.

Alice and I went for our walk at 3:15 am. It's getting ridiculous. I went back to bed when we got home and now it's 6:00 am and that feels much more reasonable. I've been running on five hours sleep a night for a while now and I don't think it's good for me. I'm not 20 years old.

However, I do like to keep an eye on overall traffic and things like 404s, so I've re-installed [[https://goaccess.io/][GoAccess]] on the server so I can pop in as needed and review.

Against my better judgement, I spent the first half of yesterday continuing to try [[https://regolith-linux.org][Regolith Linux]]. Honestly, on the big monitor, with a decent mouse and keyboard, I could see a path to Linux full-time when it comes to general computing. This hit home after I'd switched back to my MacBook Pro and after a few minutes thought, "Well, this kind of sucks." I was referring to window management on macOS, and the fact that there isn't any. It's all manual and I noticed that I spend a lot of time micro-manging windows. I immediately missed the Workspaces and i3 setup in Regolith. Didn't expect that! I started to feel that after a couple more days, I would be able to have windows placed right where I want them, but without actually needing to /put/ them there. That would be cool.

And on Linux I have my beloved Emacs and a decent web browser. I have a nice terminal. I have competent file management. I have /control/.

What I don't have is a good way to handle photos. Photo management and editing on Linux is where things start to fall apart. The tools are better than I remember, but they're no match for Capture One, Photo Mechanic, Lightroom, Photoshop, etc. It's not even close, really. I like Darktable and Shotwell and Rawtherapee well enough, and they get the job done, but they're still too janky to live with all the time. In fact, I feel that way about much of Linux; it gets the job done, but there are a lot of rough edges that take the joy out of it. But just imagine if I could sand those smooth.

I woke this morning unable to stop thinking about all this-wondering. I'm writing this while sitting at the ThinkPad plugged into the big screen and learning and swearing, but feeling pretty good. This is currently classified as an "experiment".

Thinking maybe this today:

I love how the [[https://us.kef.com/speaker/computer-speakers/lsx-wireless-music-system.html][KEF LSX]] speakers sound, a lot, but they don't work consistently with Roon. This makes me feel less badly about [[https://baty.blog/2022/leaving-roon/][Leaving Roon]]. I'm now either using AirPlay or a stereo mini cable.

Spending half my day yesterday installing [[https://regolith-linux.org][Regolith Linux]] on an old ThinkPad was fun, but useless. I should stop wasting my time like that.

For a time, I thought I'd stick with my Mac on the desktop and use Linux for my portable workstation. Linux is fun to tinker with. There are dozens of variations try. It's got the right philosophy about how things should work and how computing should /be/. I like having it around, but I don't like /using/ it so much.

For years I've used a desktop Mac and a MacBook. Weary of dealing with maintaining two machines and worrying about sync, configuration, etc., I recently consolidated my computers down to one Mac. It's so much better having only one machine. I now realize just how much time I'd spent managing everything. It was /a lot/. Moving to a single-computer setup has been the most productive and satisfying change I've made in years.

And yet there I was, installing Regolith because Paul Ford mentioned it on Twitter.

#+begin_export html

I know no one cares but Regolith on Ubuntu + nord theme is a nice way to do a tiling window manager without plowing through a pile of Arch wiki pages where no one will tell you the default modifier key because you should set that yourself.

That's all it took. I thought, "Hey, that looks neat, I should throw it on the old ThinkPad!" So I did. And Paul was right. It was nice.

I'm infatuated with tiling window managers, and Regolith takes a neat approach to merging [[https://i3wm.org][i3]] and "regular" Ubuntu. I plugged it into my 32" monitor, where a window manager shines. I thought, "I could learn to live like this."

But, after a few hours, all of the little inconsistencies begin to show. I start to miss the little quality-of-life touches that I take for granted on macOS. I once again need to concern myself with sync. And oh, the new MacBook Pro M1 Pro Max is a glorious piece of hardware (and software). Unmatched, as far as I know.

One day I may go all-in on Linux. That's the only way it could work for me. That day is not today, so I need to stop spending too much time thinking it might be.

Good morning. It's 4:03 am and I'm already finished walking with Alice. I don't make coffee until 5:00 am so I've got an hour of nothing to do but chat with all of you. Hi! üëã.

I don't understand the need for "writing prompts". Unless writing is your job, or you're working on a book, if you don't feel like writing, maybe just don't write and stop worrying about it?

Paul Ford's "scratchy mouth feel" describes how I feel about a lot of things:

I still can't stop thinking about Linux. Or playing with it, for that matter.

Good morning. It's 4:50 am and I'm probably going to install [[https://regolith-linux.org][Regolith]] today on the old ThinkPad. I swore I was done tinkering with Linux but ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø.

I've had to remove my plausible.io analytics scripts due to very slow loading.

I'm writing this using Emacs in a fresh Regolith install runnin on my old ThinkPad. About to try a deployment from here as well. If you can read this, I've successfully wasted an entire morning.

I've been thinking about killing Roon and moving to Apple Music. But I have a lifetime license to Roon, so that's weird. The trouble is that Roon doesn't work for me unless it's also connected to Qobuz, which costs me $15/month.

Currently, I pay for Qobuz, Spotify, and Apple Music. That's nuts. Qobuz is fine, but it's no longer the only decent Hi-Res option in town. I've never liked Spotify, but I have family that lives there. I have an Apple One family account, so I'm already paying for everyone to have Music.

Apple Music is not a great app and it's not the smartest streaming service, but I get it with the rest of the Apple One subscription, so that's where I'm headed.

I'm just going to have to bite the bullet and wean everyone from Spotify. And I'm going to have to wean myself from the wonders of Roon, for streaming, at least. Roon still works great with my local music library.

So, I'm not actually leaving Roon. I'm leaving Qobuz, but the effect will be similar.

What do I get in return for all the time and thought I put into taking notes? I
mean, I put a /lot/ of thought into it. What's in it for me? For example, I've been
meticulously recording my meals since December. I can tell you how many times I
ate fast food or had pancakes for breakfast. Big whoop! There is almost zero
lingering value in doing it other than that it's neat. Is "neat" enough to
justify the effort it took to set up the logging process and the ongoing effort
of recording every meal? It's fun to set up, but if I'm honest, it's not useful.
I don't need more excuses to play with my note-taking tools. I should stop
doing it.

I would like pricing pressure for software to go up, but for subscriptions to go down. I'll happily pay $250 for a great app, but don't want to pay more than $12/year for a read-it-later service or newsletter or magazine. The number of apps I need is rather low. The number services, news, and entertainment options I need approaches infinity and I just don't have the budget for that.

Logseq is for those who don't know Emacs. Hell, just about /everything/ is for people who don't know Emacs.

I'm afraid to commit to anything because what if I end up wasting my life on it? So instead, I waste my life doing nothing.

Spending a bit of time in the darkroom today. I caught up on my contact sheets so far. There was a roll of Fuji Superia in the Nikon F-100 so I fired off a bunch of flash shots to finish the roll. I'm going to process it in my old C-41 chemistry and hope for the best because I don't want to mix up a fresh batch.

It's hard giving up Emacs for writing and publishing. Correction, it's impossible. I'll probably continue to create a trickle of posts here, simply because I enjoy the environment so much.
