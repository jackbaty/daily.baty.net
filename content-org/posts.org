I've been trying [[https://www.raycast.com/][Raycast]] and it has some neat ideas. I'm not sure yet if it's better than [[https://www.alfredapp.com][Alfred]], but it's fun to try a new approach to what for me has become workflow plumbing.

I should start a new site at weekly.baty.net where I summarize everything from here and [[https://rudimentarylathe.wiki][the wiki]] and the blog (ahem, blogs). It might also make for a sustainable and mildly interesting newsletter.

What if I were to start thinking of all my blogs and wikis and streams and such as projects? This site is my "Daily Notes" project. I have a "Wiki Project" over at [[https://rudimentarylathe.org][rudimentarylathe.wiki]]. I also like the word "experiment" but I'm thinking "project" has a more bite-sized and tangible ring to it, somehow.

Well, shit, now this "projects" idea has taken hold of me. Update: I started poking around looking for ideas and found [[https://tinyprojects.dev/][Tiny Projects]] by Ben Stokes. He also made [[https://paperwebsite.com/][Paper Website: Start a tiny website from your notebook]], which is the coolest idea and I'm pissed I didn't think of it

I posted about my scanning woes: [[https://baty.blog/2021/too-bad-about-the-primefilm-xas-scanner/][Too bad about the PrimeFilm XAs Scanner]].

A pet peeve of mine is when a website complains that the phone number I entered contains non-numeric characters. Computers are smart and are perfectly capable of filtering out unwanted characters and validating what's left all by themselves. Don't make me do it.

It is such a relief to have lost interest in running Linux on the desktop.

Sometimes, not always, but sometimes it is just sour grapes.

I may need to talk about the camera situation, soon. I have no business having all three of these:

Her posts are always full of cool Emacs tricks and news and no matter where I am in the Emacs pendulum's swing, I fire it up and start tweaking. For example, I abandoned this site nearly a week ago, moving my daily notes back to [[https://rudimentarylathe.wiki][the wiki]], and yet here I am, in Emacs, writing this post in Org mode. And I must admit, it feels pretty good.

Emacs is no longer hanging when writing the markdown files from ox-hugo. I wish I knew why. It bugged me so much yesterday that I <mark>set up a Ghost Pro account</mark> and started a blog to see if Ghost could manage daily posts. This is not a good idea, probably.

Good morning. It's 4:35 am and <mark>my ears are cold</mark> after walking Alice this morning. I'm trying to hold off until at least 5:00 am before making coffee each morning. I'm definitely watching the clock right now.

[[/img/2021/20211207-50-questions.png]]

For all the time and energy I spend on my <mark>logging system(s)</mark>, it's embarrassing how infrequently I actually use them to look things up. What's even the point? I wonder if my overall happiness would improve if I just stopped doing it. Jot down a few crucial details during the week and let the river of time wash away the rest.

Today, I'm thinking that [[https://logseq.com][Logseq]] offers the best friction to value ratio, while still being local-first and plain text. It's dead-simple to add notes and offers nice backlinks and graphing. The graph is unnecessary but is a free byproduct, so why not? It beats Roam for privacy, cost, and attitude. It beats TiddlyWiki for ease of use and usefulness outside of the app. Plus, the files are in Org format. What's not to like?

Yeah, the contradiction of the two previous paragraphs is not lost on me.

As much as I love the idea of the [[https://johnnydecimal.com][Johnny.Decimal]] system, I've utterly failed at maintaining mine.

[[https://linkingmanifesto.org/][Linking Manifesto ‚Äì Manifesto for Ubiquitous Linking]] seems useful, but how does it go anywhere?

My mood this week is one of removing the necessity, nay, the /ability/ to customize and configure the apps I use to do stuff. For some reason, I've not been tweaking my Emacs config much, so that's a relief. Back to Things, then?

Oh joy, <mark>Emacs crashes</mark> every time I save this file. I'm editing it in [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html) right now... TAKE THAT EMACS! Ok, now I'm testing to see if it's related to the automatic saving/exporting in ox-hugo. Hmm, seems to be. If I edit (in Emacs) the markdown file directly, all is well. So now what?

I haven't taken enough photos with them yet, but they sure look pretty just sitting there waiting for me.

I keep thinking about <mark>running this blog as baty.blog</mark> (replacing Drummer). "daily.baty.net" is good because it explicitly indicates what the site is for. Also, it keeps me from breaking URLs and RSS feeds...again. Maybe I should just leave well enough alone.

Ever since <mark>moving the Synology</mark> to my basement office, all I hear are its drives, constantly grinding away. It's a little crazy-making. It does help remind me to turn on some music, though.

I put together a Blurb book today for 2021 family photos. I don't love the design, captions, or layout, but if I fuss with it too much it never gets done, so I just cranked it out in a couple hours and sent it to print.

I went to post the following notes about Setapp on the [[https://copingmechanism.com][copingmechanism.com]] blog but after only posting about photography there for so long it felt out of place. Still not sure what to do about that, so in the meantime I'm thinking of <mark>collecting longer "posts" here</mark>, but under a heading, and at the end/bottom of each day's post. The rest will just flow top-to-bottom above that. Let's see how it feels.

I take photos with very <mark>fancy cameras</mark> and do some detailed edit work in Lightroom. I often message these photos to family or friends. They respond with an emoji or short "Ha!" and move on. No word on the superlative micro-contrast or dreamy bokeh or light falloff or how nicely-composed they are. ü•∫. Still, /I/ know!

[[/img/2021/20211204-the-portable-atheist.png]]

You'll have noticed I'm experimenting with adding some (hopefully) <mark>subtle highlights to words or phrases</mark> within individual paragraphs. The idea is to make it easier to scan and see what the hell I'm talking about each day without needing to read so much. I don't know yet if I'll continue with it, so let me know if you find it either useful or annoying.

Subscribed to [[https://georgesaunders.substack.com/][Story Club]], <mark>George Saunder's newsletter</mark>. (Thanks to Tully for the recommendation). I'm starting with the free subscription, but if it turns out anything like everything else Saunder's has written, I'll be paying.

Speaking of newsletters, now that I've been using a "blog" for my daily notes, it occurred to me that this format could also work as a daily-ish email newsletter. Have to think about that. Would anyone be interested in an email version of this blog, copy and pasted daily into [[https://thelathe.substack.com/][my Substack newsletter]]? Now that this blog has RSS, it seems less necessary but who knows?

At some point I'm going to need to add search here, somehow.

I enjoy writing, but have no desire to be "A Writer".

I moved my Synology to the basement and wired it into my Mac's hub. [[https://rudimentarylathe.wiki/#Connecting%20Mac%20directly%20to%20Synology%20via%20Ethernet][Here are some details]]

*** What of Setapp?

#+attr_html: :class imgRightMargin
[[/img/small/setapp-logo.png]]

I'm thinking about not installing (and hence not subscribing to) [[https://setapp.com][Setapp]] once the new machine arrives. Here are the Setapp apps I still have installed:

#+caption: Setapp apps on my Macs
[[/img/2021/20211204-setapp.png]]

Of those, I don't use Path Finder unless I need a quick directory comparison. There are other tools for that, but I'm lazy. I rarely use Gemini, or Better Touch Tool. I use Emacs instead of MetaImage. I already own a standalone license for Forklift, which is indispensable. The apps I'll need to buy/license are:

CleanMyMac, $34.95/year. I use this weekly and love it. There's an option to buy a license outright for
CleanShot X $29 one time. Far and away the best screenshot tool. I use it all day.
HoudahSpot, $0. I own a license. Way better than using Spotlight for search.
TablePlus, $69 one time. Favorite database management tool. I don't use it often, so this may not be necessary.

That is a one-time payment of $98 plus a couple bucks a month for CleanMyMac. If I skip TablePlus the one-time amount drops to $29.

So after a few months I'm down from $9.99/month for Setapp with access to more than a hundred apps, to just shy of $3.00/month for one app and I own one or two others outright. That extra $7.00/month gives me access to a nearly bottomless well of utilities and toys. I don't think the savings is worth what I'm giving up. Seems I've convinced myself to continue paying for Setapp.

No doubt I'll be spending the day with the new camera. Both the camera and lens sure are pretty.

I love how most of the things I buy are meant to help me "simplify".

Any reviewer who includes "No auto-focus" as a "Con" has no business reviewing a Leica M.

Doing my best to ignore this: [[https://www.craft.do/s/lEjdSXBpq9jSgg][2.0 - Craft update]]. Thing about Craft is that it's a fantastic app but feels too "heavy" for me. Like I'm always /working/ on writing instead of just writing.

On the other hand, a few days back in [[https://logseq.com][Logseq]] have been very refreshing and positive.

We're what, a dozen years in, and I don't see blockchain doing anything useful in the world. Maybe next year?

- Leica 35mm f2.0 APO Summicron SL
- Leica 35mm f2.0 Summicron-M ASPH V1
- Leica M4
- Leica 50mm f2.0 Summicron-M v4

Do you ever tire of organizing things on the computer? Folders, documents, photos, and on and on. I'm sure tired of it. My [[https://johnnydecimal.com][Johnny.Decimal]]-based folder system is mostly in disarray and the "_Filing Cabinet Inbox" folder is full of stuff I've yet to file. I don't feel like dealing with it. It's just busywork. I just want to pour everything into a couple of top-level folders and let HoudahSpot sort-em out as needed.

Making fun of people or things publicly is a chickenshit move and seems to be the raison d'etre of most people on social media lately.

I've been using [[https://alfred.camera/][Alfred Camera | Simple Security at Your Fingertips]] with an old iPhone 6 as a front door camera. The free version was good enough (one camera, one viewer, limited features) but suddenly the app became riddled with obnoxious ads. I can pay $16.99 for no ads or subscribe for $3.99/month to get no ads plus the extra features. Maybe I should research a privacy-conscious, local-first DIY solution.

I was hoping to spend some time away from the computer today, but instead got sucked into watching videos about and around the M10-R and Summilux 35mm. Then I watched more about photography in general. Then I realized that 80% of YouTube channels are crap content factories, publishing for the sake of publishing and have long ago run out of interesting things to say. So, basically, I've wasted most of the day. I did get a haircut, so at least I'm devastatingly handsome.

I remain very much undecided about keeping this daily blog in Org mode or moving it back into TiddlyWiki. If anyone is reading this and has an opinion, I'd love to hear from you. The thing about the wiki is it's always right there in my browser and it's already done. No need to configure/tweak/change much ever. There's something to that. On the other hand, this blog is managed in a single org mode outline and is published to a nice-looking blog with RSS and everything. It's "normal", which seems like it would be better suited to casual readers. So...yeah.

Made a small donation to [[https://archive.org/][Internet Archive]]. You might consider doing the same. It's a precious resource.

Don't assume you know the motivations of others...people or companies. You don't.

Good morning. It's 5:20 am and this morning's walk was through 2" of new snow. Alice likes to roll in it.

I almost left the MP sitting on a table at the restaurant last night. What an idiot. I don't deserve nice things.

Still waffling about splitting these daily notes out of the wiki. This is mostly because I got into a lazy mood yesterday in which I stopped wanting to work to maintain anything. This blog doesn't require effort to maintain all the time, but there's a lot going on in support of it. If any part of that breaks down, I'm going to lose interest quickly. Another aspect is that when I was doing this in the wiki, /everything/ was in the wiki. That's kind of nice. One big HTML file with it all right there. This blog has everything in one big org outline, which is nice, but in order to get a usable, parsable website out of it, it needs to be rendered. The wiki /is already/ a fully functional website.

I fart around with different cameras so much because I shoot the same subjects all the time. It would be better to use the same camera but with different subjects.

Good morning. It's 5:54 am and I have different coffee this morning and I don't love it.

[[/img/2021/20211126-more-baths-less-talking.png]]

I'm supposed to journal and blog as ways to write about what I'm thinking and feeling, but I too often instead write about /writing about/ what I'm thinking and feeling.

I hesitate to publicly compliment people because so much of social media is people blowing smoke up the asses of others for attention. That's not what I'm doing when I compliment someone. This is why I often send a (private) email instead.

Progressive Rock, NWOBHM, and pre-Nu Metal are the best genres of music.

Maintaining the blog and the wiki is kind of unnecessary, but I do like the clean, tidy, mobile-friendly rendering of this theme. And I like writing in Org and Emacs. One decision yet to be made is whether to stop the Daily Notes completely on the wiki, and just point out any significant new content from here. Or who knows, I could end up back all-in TiddlyWiki. Wouldn't be the first time. I'm having fun right now, though.

I'm pretty much over trying to manage email in either mutt or mu4e. I just sent a long note to someone using Mu4e and the formatting was terrible, mostly around line breaks (there weren't any). Looked good in Emacs though! I don't care enough to fight it. Mail.app it is.

So far, having the Q2 in a box is not disturbing at all. In fact, it's a relief.

Keyboards don't need to be wireless, but mice sure do.

I wish Safari's pinned tabs persisted across tab groups.

The built-in Weather app on iOS is good enough. I can probably delete the 35 other weather-related apps I've installed.

The Friday after Thanksgiving used to be one of the best days of the year, but after being on sabbatical for so long, it feels like just another day. And an annoying one, since everyone and their brother is out shopping so I'll need to avoid going anywhere at all today.

I'm still thinking about consolodating my 2 Macs into one new MBP. Last night, Fish shell kept throwing errors on the Air, even though it uses the same config as the Mini. The fact that I need to worry about syncing the configs is another reason for this line of reasoning. I'm so tired of managing the environment in two places. Another solution is to use stock Apple apps like Notes and friends and just let things take care of themselves but we all know that won't happen. Another aspect of this is that when I've nothing specific to do, a 32-inch monitor is rife with distractions. I can usually see a half-dozen app windows at once. Any of which could distract me at any moment. The thing is too big to maximize windows.

I ordered a new computer today: [[https://rudimentarylathe.wiki/#MacBook%20Pro%20M1%20Max%20(2020)][MacBook Pro 14" M1 Max]]. I think this will be a great thing to have done. I have reasons, of course. And I have also, of course, convinced myself they're damn good reasons. Mostly, I want to only manage one computer. Can you imagine not worrying about sync or configuration, or settings or picking up where you left off? I can.

And now I want this: [[https://www.vava.com/products/vava-4k-ultra-short-throw-laser-tv-2?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIsLnzhfSz9AIVSsiUCR2pVgwnEAAYASAAEgJs0_D_BwE][4K Ultra Short Throw Laser TV Projector- VAVA]]

I took the straps off all my cameras today and it feels wonderfully liberating. I hate straps, and I never go anywhere I need to dangle the camera from my neck the whole time, so this is great.

The worst part about blogging with something like Hugo via text files is that when I read something on the website and want to edit it, I have to go way over into another app, find the file, edit, and republish. Where in something like TiddlyWiki or Ghost I can simply click the edit button. Even Drummer is just a browser tab away from the actual thing.

To add a Drummer-inspired image floating down the right side of a paragraph (like the Hugo logo above), do this...

#+begin_src org
#+attr_html: :class imgRightMargin
[[/img/foo.jpg]]
#+end_src

The =#+attr_html:= must be directly above the image link, along with any other attributes like =#+caption:=

I must admit that having this blog and my personal (org) journal in 2 side-by-side Emacs buffers is pretty sweet.

[[/img/2021/20211125-emacs-journal-n-blog.png]]

Oh, and [[https://orgmode.org][Org mode]] kicks Markdown's ass all the way down the street and back.

I love that this place is 100% mine. I can host it where and how I like. I can modify it if and when I like. I decide what goes where and how it gets there. There's something to be said for all this, even though it's a little more work up front. A fair trade-off. The only part I don't have complete control over right now is hosting. I'm using Cloudflare Pages via Github so I suppose they could muck things up, but I'm not worried about it because everything is local-first and I can simply push it out to a tiny VPS anywhere and I'm back in action.

I've started posting directly to Twitter and/or Mastodon rather than posting to Micro.blog first and having it cross-post for me. I like deciding what goes where and whether it needs minor changes to wording, etc. I also don't feel the need for an actual microblog any more.

I've removed the dayname from each post's "slug" because I want to be able to hack the URL by putting in a date and don't want to need to know what day that date was on. So we're back to =/2021-11-25/=. Sorry if I broke any links.

I've also added date/author info to the bottom of individual posts. I like seeing the date and time a post was last modified. The theme came with author and License stuff built-in, so I kept that, too.

I boxed up the Q2 today. I'm just testing the waters to see if I miss it. If I don't, I'm going to trade up to an M10-P (again).

06:41 Since I'm writing this in an Emacs buffer, it feels more natural to add my notes from the top down rather than reverse-chronologically. Should I timestamp each note like I did this one? (*A:* No, I don't like it.)

Sorry if today's notes become awash in Emacs minutiae. I'm working this out. There's no question that I /much/ prefer writing in Emacs than a text area in TiddlyWiki or the Drummer outliner.

Good grief, Soulver is such a great app. I've used it for years and almost forget it's not built-in. [[https://soulver.app/][Soulver 3 - Notepad Calculator App for Mac]]

I need to decide on permalinks. Currently, they are /YYYY-MM-DD (=:slug= in Hugo). The files are actually rendered into yearly folders e.g. =YYYY/YYYY-MM-DD.md=. The duplicate year bugs me a little. Perhaps I should go with something easier to read for the slug, like =YYYY/MM-DD-Weekday.md=. Today's would be "/2021/11-24-Wednesday". After thinking about it, I am going without the fake year subfolder but am adding the weekday because I like knowing that without having to look it up. Settled!

The free version of Cloudflare Pages is limited to 500 "builds" per month. That means I can re-render this blog 10 times a day and still have plenty left. I bet I push the wiki at least that many times, so I do need to be a little careful. Worst case I just move the whole enterprise to a static site on my server and rsync to my heart's content.

I'm having a hard time getting comfortable using iCloud drive for syncing everything. I've already moved ~/org out since paths get wonky even when using symlinks to fake them. The iCloud process has hung twice recently. A sync solution can be slow, or weird, but what it can't be is unreliable.

I have been unable to play from Roon to the KEF LSX speakers for nearly a week. I've tried everything I can think of. I'm no using AirPlay from the Apple Music app. Not ideal, but at least it works.

I finally finished the roll in the M6. I took it out of the camera only to discover it's Portra 400. Color, dammit. I don't have any fresh chemicals. The only reason I have any mixed is that I've been too lazy to dispose of them. Screw it, I thought, and fired up the JOBO anyway. They're drying now. I don't know how they'll look, but there's /something/ on there.

There are several ways to approach images in ox-hugo. I'm trying three of them in this post :). First, I drag and drop an image into the buffer and it's automatically, via org-attach, moved into ./attach/XX/UUIDfilename.jpg. A link is inserted and when rendering markdown, it uses Hugo's "figure" short code. This is the easiest option to do, but has the most moving parts. I don't like that I don't have control over the precise path. Second, I just link to the URL of an image in SmugMug. Super easy, but I do have to upload the image then grab the "share" link. Not bad. The third option is to generate a local file link like =[[img/foo.jpg]]=.  This feels the most self-contained and tidy, but means exporting a specifically-sized image, naming it something, copying that name, and moving it into the static/img/etc. folder. I'll probably try all three ways for a bit to see which feels best.

I've been having a lot of fun in the darkroom lately.

I was cleaning up some old files and ran into a folder full of Org mode files that had at one time generated my Hugo-based blog.

In the folder is a file named "posts.org" which is an Org mode file, thus is basically an outline that renders out as a blog. Same as [[http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/about.opml][Drummer]]!
