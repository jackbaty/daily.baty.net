☁️ Overcast +48°F

Good morning. It's 5:48 am and I just had nearly eight ours of uninterupted sleep. My brain is buzzing. Oh, and happy Thanksgiving, 'muricans.

The worst part about blogging with something like Hugo via text files is that when I read something on the website and want to edit it, I have to go way over into another app, find the file, edit, and republish. Where in something like TiddlyWiki or Ghost I can simply click the edit button. Even Drummer is just a browser tab away from the actual thing.

To add a Drummer-inspired image floating down the right side of a paragraph (like the Hugo logo above), do this...

#+begin_src org
#+attr_html: :class imgRightMargin
[[/img/foo.jpg]]
#+end_src

The =#+attr_html:= must be directly above the image link, along with any other attributes like =#+caption:=

I must admit that having this blog and my personal (org) journal in 2 side-by-side Emacs buffers is pretty sweet.

Oh, and [[https://orgmode.org][Org mode]] kicks Markdown's ass all the way down the street and back.

I love that this place is 100% mine. I can host it where and how I like. I can modify it if and when I like. I decide what goes where and how it gets there. There's something to be said for all this, even though it's a little more work up front. A fair trade-off. The only part I don't have complete control over right now is hosting. I'm using Cloudflare Pages via Github so I suppose they could muck things up, but I'm not worried about it because everything is local-first and I can simply push it out to a tiny VPS anywhere and I'm back in action.

I've started posting directly to Twitter and/or Mastodon rather than posting to Micro.blog first and having it cross-post for me. I like deciding what goes where and whether it needs minor changes to wording, etc. I also don't feel the need for an actual microblog any more.

☀️ Clear +37°F

Good morning. It's 5:55 am and this morning's walk was pleasant and uneventful. Very dark.

06:41 Since I'm writing this in an Emacs buffer, it feels more natural to add my notes from the top down rather than reverse-chronologically. Should I timestamp each note like I did this one? (*A:* No, I don't like it.)

Sorry if today's notes become awash in Emacs minutiae. I'm working this out. There's no question that I /much/ prefer writing in Emacs than a text area in TiddlyWiki or the Drummer outliner.

Good grief, Soulver is such a great app. I've used it for years and almost forget it's not built-in. [[https://soulver.app/][Soulver 3 - Notepad Calculator App for Mac]]

I need to decide on permalinks. Currently, they are /YYYY-MM-DD (=:slug= in Hugo). The files are actually rendered into yearly folders e.g. =YYYY/YYYY-MM-DD.md=. The duplicate year bugs me a little. Perhaps I should go with something easier to read for the slug, like =YYYY/MM-DD-Weekday.md=. Today's would be "/2021/11-24-Wednesday". After thinking about it, I am going without the fake year subfolder but am adding the weekday because I like knowing that without having to look it up. Settled!

The free version of Cloudflare Pages is limited to 500 "builds" per month. That means I can re-render this blog 10 times a day and still have plenty left. I bet I push the wiki at least that many times, so I do need to be a little careful. Worst case I just move the whole enterprise to a static site on my server and rsync to my heart's content.

I'm having a hard time getting comfortable using iCloud drive for syncing everything. I've already moved ~/org out since paths get wonky even when using symlinks to fake them. The iCloud process has hung twice recently. A sync solution can be slow, or weird, but what it can't be is unreliable.

I have been unable to play from Roon to the KEF LSX speakers for nearly a week. I've tried everything I can think of. I'm no using AirPlay from the Apple Music app. Not ideal, but at least it works.

I finally finished the roll in the M6. I took it out of the camera only to discover it's Portra 400. Color, dammit. I don't have any fresh chemicals. The only reason I have any mixed is that I've been too lazy to dispose of them. Screw it, I thought, and fired up the JOBO anyway. They're drying now. I don't know how they'll look, but there's /something/ on there.

There are several ways to approach images in ox-hugo. I'm trying three of them in this post :). First, I drag and drop an image into the buffer and it's automatically, via org-attach, moved into ./attach/XX/UUIDfilename.jpg. A link is inserted and when rendering markdown, it uses Hugo's "figure" short code. This is the easiest option to do, but has the most moving parts. I don't like that I don't have control over the precise path. Second, I just link to the URL of an image in SmugMug. Super easy, but I do have to upload the image then grab the "share" link. Not bad. The third option is to generate a local file link like =[[img/foo.jpg]]=.  This feels the most self-contained and tidy, but means exporting a specifically-sized image, naming it something, copying that name, and moving it into the static/img/etc. folder. I'll probably try all three ways for a bit to see which feels best.

I've been having a lot of fun in the darkroom lately.

Blogging with Drummer feels like using someone else's bathroom. I really have to go, and it's a nice bathroom, but it's not mine and I can't really relax, ya know?

I was cleaning up some old files and ran into a folder full of Org mode files that had at one time generated my Hugo-based blog.

In the folder is a file named "posts.org" which is an Org mode file, thus is basically an outline that renders out as a blog. Same as [[http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/about.opml][Drummer]]!
