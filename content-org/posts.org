No doubt I'll be spending the day with the new camera. Both the camera and lens sure are pretty.

I love how most of the things I buy are meant to help me "simplify".

Any reviewer who includes "No auto-focus" as a "Con" has no business reviewing a Leica M.

Good morning. It's 5:15 am and it occurs to me that my net worth keeps going down and my weight keeps going up.

It would be better to check in and see what the world is up to maybe once a week, and spend the rest of the time being up to something myself. But what I actually do is check in with the world continuously throughout each day, leaving no time for doing anything.

Guess I'll be reloading the FedEx pages for my new camera and lens all day. FedEx says "Delivered by today" but the packages are still in Indianapolis this morning and FedEx has been wrong 90% of the time lately. Still, ü§û

Do you ever tire of organizing things on the computer? Folders, documents, photos, and on and on. I'm sure tired of it. My [[https://johnnydecimal.com][Johnny.Decimal]]-based folder system is mostly in disarray and the "_Filing Cabinet Inbox" folder is full of stuff I've yet to file. I don't feel like dealing with it. It's just busywork. I just want to pour everything into a couple of top-level folders and let HoudahSpot sort-em out as needed.

Making fun of people or things publicly is a chickenshit move and seems to be the raison d'etre of most people on social media lately.

I've been using [[https://alfred.camera/][Alfred Camera | Simple Security at Your Fingertips]] with an old iPhone 6 as a front door camera. The free version was good enough (one camera, one viewer, limited features) but suddenly the app became riddled with obnoxious ads. I can pay $16.99 for no ads or subscribe for $3.99/month to get no ads plus the extra features. Maybe I should research a privacy-conscious, local-first DIY solution.

I was hoping to spend some time away from the computer today, but instead got sucked into watching videos about and around the M10-R and Summilux 35mm. Then I watched more about photography in general. Then I realized that 80% of YouTube channels are crap content factories, publishing for the sake of publishing and have long ago run out of interesting things to say. So, basically, I've wasted most of the day. I did get a haircut, so at least I'm devastatingly handsome.

Camera and lens have shipped and FedEx says arriving tomorrow but they've been wrong about the last 9 out of 10 deliveries so I'm not getting my hopes up. ü§ûüì∑

More and more of my days are spent fighting the feeling of tech exhaustion. I'm tired of all of it.

I wish I would never have purchased the Leica APO Summicrons for the SL2-S. I'm trying to sell them to fund the new camera but they are just so astonishingly good that I'm having a hard time.

I remain very much undecided about keeping this daily blog in Org mode or moving it back into TiddlyWiki. If anyone is reading this and has an opinion, I'd love to hear from you. The thing about the wiki is it's always right there in my browser and it's already done. No need to configure/tweak/change much ever. There's something to that. On the other hand, this blog is managed in a single org mode outline and is published to a nice-looking blog with RSS and everything. It's "normal", which seems like it would be better suited to casual readers. So...yeah.

Made a small donation to [[https://archive.org/][Internet Archive]]. You might consider doing the same. It's a precious resource.

I see [[https://twitter.com/jack/status/1465347002426867720][@jack has resigned]] as CEO of Twitter. I've been mostly OK with him over the years. I'm mildly interested in what others think, but not enough to listen to 27 million hot takes by 27 million newly-minted experts in whatever field they think this falls under.

I'm trying hard to not be one of those people who are bitter and cynical about everything. I think it's working, but it's definitely uphill. Based on my social media feeds, most people don't make it. (Or aren't even trying.)

Don't assume you know the motivations of others...people or companies. You don't.

I am about to be the owner of a Leica M10-R with 35mm Summilux-M FLE. Wow. I had to give up the Q2, 35mm Summicron-M ASPH, 35mm APO Summicron-SL, and my M4 to cover it. We'll see how it feels in a few days!

Good morning. It's 5:20 am and this morning's walk was through 2" of new snow. Alice likes to roll in it.

I almost left the MP sitting on a table at the restaurant last night. What an idiot. I don't deserve nice things.

Still waffling about splitting these daily notes out of the wiki. This is mostly because I got into a lazy mood yesterday in which I stopped wanting to work to maintain anything. This blog doesn't require effort to maintain all the time, but there's a lot going on in support of it. If any part of that breaks down, I'm going to lose interest quickly. Another aspect is that when I was doing this in the wiki, /everything/ was in the wiki. That's kind of nice. One big HTML file with it all right there. This blog has everything in one big org outline, which is nice, but in order to get a usable, parsable website out of it, it needs to be rendered. The wiki /is already/ a fully functional website. I like that part of it.

I'm supposed to journal and blog as ways to write about what I'm thinking and feeling, but I too often instead write about /writing about/ what I'm thinking and feeling.

I hesitate to publicly compliment people because so much of social media is people blowing smoke up the asses of others for attention. That's not what I'm doing when I compliment someone. This is why I often send a (private) email instead.

Progressive Rock, NWOBHM, and pre-Nu Metal are the best genres of music.

Maintaining the blog and the wiki is kind of unnecessary, but I do like the clean, tidy, mobile-friendly rendering of this theme. And I like writing in Org and Emacs. One decision yet to be made is whether to stop the Daily Notes completely on the wiki, and just point out any significant new content from here. Or who knows, I could end up back all-in TiddlyWiki. Wouldn't be the first time. I'm having fun right now, though.

I'm pretty much over trying to manage email in either mutt or mu4e. I just sent a long note to someone using Mu4e and the formatting was terrible, mostly around line breaks (there weren't any). Looked good in Emacs though! I don't care enough to fight it. Mail.app it is.

So far, having the Q2 in a box is not disturbing at all. In fact, it's a relief.

Keyboards don't need to be wireless, but mice sure do.

I wish Safari's pinned tabs persisted across tab groups.

The built-in Weather app on iOS is good enough. I can probably delete the 35 other weather-related apps I've installed.

The Friday after Thanksgiving used to be one of the best days of the year, but after being on sabbatical for so long, it feels like just another day. And an annoying one, since everyone and their brother is out shopping so I'll need to avoid going anywhere at all today.

I'm still thinking about consolodating my 2 Macs into one new MBP. Last night, Fish shell kept throwing errors on the Air, even though it uses the same config as the Mini. The fact that I need to worry about syncing the configs is another reason for this line of reasoning. I'm so tired of managing the environment in two places. Another solution is to use stock Apple apps like Notes and friends and just let things take care of themselves but we all know that won't happen. Another aspect of this is that when I've nothing specific to do, a 32-inch monitor is rife with distractions. I can usually see a half-dozen app windows at once. Any of which could distract me at any moment. The thing is too big to maximize windows.

I ordered a new computer today: [[https://rudimentarylathe.wiki/#MacBook%20Pro%20M1%20Max%20(2020)][MacBook Pro 14" M1 Max]]. I think this will be a great thing to have done. I have reasons, of course. And I have also, of course, convinced myself they're damn good reasons. Mostly, I want to only manage one computer. Can you imagine not worrying about sync or configuration, or settings or picking up where you left off? I can.

And now I want this: [[https://www.vava.com/products/vava-4k-ultra-short-throw-laser-tv-2?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIsLnzhfSz9AIVSsiUCR2pVgwnEAAYASAAEgJs0_D_BwE][4K Ultra Short Throw Laser TV Projector- VAVA]]

The worst part about blogging with something like Hugo via text files is that when I read something on the website and want to edit it, I have to go way over into another app, find the file, edit, and republish. Where in something like TiddlyWiki or Ghost I can simply click the edit button. Even Drummer is just a browser tab away from the actual thing.

To add a Drummer-inspired image floating down the right side of a paragraph (like the Hugo logo above), do this...

Oh, and [[https://orgmode.org][Org mode]] kicks Markdown's ass all the way down the street and back.

I love that this place is 100% mine. I can host it where and how I like. I can modify it if and when I like. I decide what goes where and how it gets there. There's something to be said for all this, even though it's a little more work up front. A fair trade-off. The only part I don't have complete control over right now is hosting. I'm using Cloudflare Pages via Github so I suppose they could muck things up, but I'm not worried about it because everything is local-first and I can simply push it out to a tiny VPS anywhere and I'm back in action.

I've started posting directly to Twitter and/or Mastodon rather than posting to Micro.blog first and having it cross-post for me. I like deciding what goes where and whether it needs minor changes to wording, etc. I also don't feel the need for an actual microblog any more.

I've removed the dayname from each post's "slug" because I want to be able to hack the URL by putting in a date and don't want to need to know what day that date was on. So we're back to =/2021-11-25/=. Sorry if I broke any links.

I've also added date/author info to the bottom of individual posts. I like seeing the date and time a post was last modified. The theme came with author and License stuff built-in, so I kept that, too.

I boxed up the Q2 today. I'm just testing the waters to see if I miss it. If I don't, I'm going to trade up to an M10-P (again).

06:41 Since I'm writing this in an Emacs buffer, it feels more natural to add my notes from the top down rather than reverse-chronologically. Should I timestamp each note like I did this one? (*A:* No, I don't like it.)

Sorry if today's notes become awash in Emacs minutiae. I'm working this out. There's no question that I /much/ prefer writing in Emacs than a text area in TiddlyWiki or the Drummer outliner.

Good grief, Soulver is such a great app. I've used it for years and almost forget it's not built-in. [[https://soulver.app/][Soulver 3 - Notepad Calculator App for Mac]]

I need to decide on permalinks. Currently, they are /YYYY-MM-DD (=:slug= in Hugo). The files are actually rendered into yearly folders e.g. =YYYY/YYYY-MM-DD.md=. The duplicate year bugs me a little. Perhaps I should go with something easier to read for the slug, like =YYYY/MM-DD-Weekday.md=. Today's would be "/2021/11-24-Wednesday". After thinking about it, I am going without the fake year subfolder but am adding the weekday because I like knowing that without having to look it up. Settled!

The free version of Cloudflare Pages is limited to 500 "builds" per month. That means I can re-render this blog 10 times a day and still have plenty left. I bet I push the wiki at least that many times, so I do need to be a little careful. Worst case I just move the whole enterprise to a static site on my server and rsync to my heart's content.

I'm having a hard time getting comfortable using iCloud drive for syncing everything. I've already moved ~/org out since paths get wonky even when using symlinks to fake them. The iCloud process has hung twice recently. A sync solution can be slow, or weird, but what it can't be is unreliable.

I have been unable to play from Roon to the KEF LSX speakers for nearly a week. I've tried everything I can think of. I'm no using AirPlay from the Apple Music app. Not ideal, but at least it works.

I finally finished the roll in the M6. I took it out of the camera only to discover it's Portra 400. Color, dammit. I don't have any fresh chemicals. The only reason I have any mixed is that I've been too lazy to dispose of them. Screw it, I thought, and fired up the JOBO anyway. They're drying now.

There are several ways to approach images in ox-hugo. I'm trying three of them in this post :). First, I drag and drop an image into the buffer and it's automatically, via org-attach, moved into ./attach/XX/UUIDfilename.jpg. A link is inserted and when rendering markdown, it uses Hugo's "figure" short code. This is the easiest option to do, but has the most moving parts. I don't like that I don't have control over the precise path. Second, I just link to the URL of an image in SmugMug. Super easy, but I do have to upload the image then grab the "share" link. Not bad. The third option is to generate a local file link like =[[img/foo.jpg]]=.  This feels the most self-contained and tidy, but means exporting a specifically-sized image, naming it something, copying that name, and moving it into the static/img/etc. folder. I'll probably try all three ways for a bit to see which feels best.

I've been having a lot of fun in the darkroom lately.
