Blogging with Drummer feels like using someone else's bathroom. I really have to go, and it's a nice bathroom, but it's not mine and I can't really relax, ya know?

*** ox-hugo feels a lot like Drummer
I was cleaning up some old files and ran into a folder full of Org mode files that had at one time generated my Hugo-based blog.

In the folder is a file named "posts.org" which is an Org mode file, thus is basically an outline that renders out as a blog. Same as [[http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/about.opml][Drummer]]!
