** DONE I'd (re)learn Ruby On Rails if it weren't for DHH

I've been tinkering with ideas for my next career, and re-learning Ruby on Rails was on the short list.

I've long admired [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Heinemeier_Hansson][DHH]] and [[https://rubyonrails.org][Rails]] and Basecamp (the [[https://basecamp.com/about][company]] and the [[https://basecamp.com/][product]]). I shipped my first Rails app in 2007. I envied the way they ran the company and how open they were about it. I lapped up all their books. I even agreed with the way they handled the whole "no political discussions" fiasco. I used to feel like he, although cocky and arrogant, was right more than he was wrong about most things.

But after reading [[https://world.hey.com/dhh][DHH's newsletter]] lately, I think I'm out.

His latest, [[https://world.hey.com/dhh/spotify-must-be-afraid-of-canceling-rogan-right-right-8fc9f1f6][Spotify must be afraid of canceling Rogan, right? Right?!]], was the final straw for me. It wasn't just the inane title, but that he keeps showing that he doesn't understand the argument and insisting that "both-sides"-ism is always OK.

Neal Young doesn't want to share a platform with Rogan. Not because Rogan "hosts guests with divergent views" because he hosts guests with demonstrably incorrect and dangerous views. DHH apparently doesn't understand science, either. Not really.

Anyway, I don't want to argue with him. And I don't want to argue /about/ him. But, he makes me want to /not/ use his products. Which is a shame because I think Rails is still a valid, viable, and valuable option. I just wanted to vent a little about my disappointment with someone who used to inspire me.

Maybe he'll calm down and get over this latest mood, or at least stop writing so much while feeling the way he seems to feel. I hope so.

‚òÄÔ∏è   Clear +15¬∞F

Got new eyeglasses yesterday. The prescription changed a bit from my previous pair. They work great, but I feel a little woozy while getting used to them.

#+attr_html: :class imgRightMargin
[[/img/small/linux.png]]

There is a nicely-configured [[https://system76.com/desktops/thelio-mira][Thelio Mira]] in my shopping cart. I came close to pulling the trigger yesterday, but a clear head prevailed. So far. I know me. In 2 weeks I'll be back on my Mac and the old ThinkPad I'm typing this on will be packed up and in the closet until next time I get the Linux itch. My thinking with the Thelio is that in order to get the full Linux experience, I should work on a faster, modern machine. There could be something to that, but mostly it's just an excuse to buy a new toy. I'm going to sit on it for a month or two and if I still think I could switch to Linux, I'll buy something nice to run it on.

Suddenly, Emacs is running slowly on the ThinkPad. Could it be that I need a faster machine?

It's hard to virtue signal while using a paper notebook. (But /mentioning/ using paper notebooks works great.)

If I could make just one photo like this one by Vivian Maier, I'd be happy:

After a morning of watching videos on [[https://www.darktable.org][Darktable]] I learn that it supports neither the SL2-S or the Q2 Monochrom. Too bad, because it's not as terrible as I remember. Rawtherapee works better, but I kind of hate using it. I'm back to feeling like iOS and macOS are the only options for seriously editing my photos.

Good morning!

[[/img/2022/20220126-L1010053.jpg]]

I've decided to {{{mark(work on my Mac today)}}}, after a few days on Linux. Apple people tend to complain a lot about the sorry state of macOS, but coming back after time away is a stark reminder of the sheer level of refinement in macOS. It's just...nice.

The [[https://system76.com/desktops/thelio-mira][Thelio Mira]] from System76 is tempting. I'd like to try a modern, powerful desktop machine running Linux. I mean, how else can I do a fair comparison with my MBP? üòú. So far I've avoided the temptation, because, I just bought a top-spec'd MacBook Pro, remember? If it weren't for wanting to edit photos with good software, I'd be much more tempted.

Living down a rabbit hole of photo editing processes, techniques, and software does nothing to improve my photography, so I'm backing off a bit and putting everything in {{{mark(baby Lightroom)}}} for a while.

I've changed tagging for financially-related items in my {{{mark(Org daybook)}}} to ":money:" because I'm tired of trying to decide/remember between :finances:, :finance:, and :financial:. Now it's just :money:

Just for fun, and as a fallback for 1Password, I've started using [[https://www.passwordstore.org/][Pass: The Standard Unix Password Manager]] again. It's been years. I started with a fresh .password-store/ and will fill it as needed.

** DONE Highlighting text in ox-hugo :Orgmode:

I've been experimenting with adding highlights to text in my daily posts. The idea is that it makes scanning easier. I pick out the important parts of each entry and add a =<mark>= HTML tag. Then I style the region like so:

#+begin_src css
mark {
  background: rgba(255, 255, 0, 0.3);
}
#+end_src

Recently, there's been a {{{mark(change in org that broke my markup)}}} when exporting from ox-hugo. Here's the comment by [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi][kaushalmodi]]:

[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/540][Issue #540]]
#+begin_quote
This was a recent breaking change that fixed an inconsistency in ox-hugo (compared to ox-html). If we want to export verbatim HTML, it needs to be in @@html:..@@ or in an HTML export block
#+end_quote

His suggestion to use a macro was excellent, so I did that. At the top of my posts.org file, is this:

=#+macro: mark @@html:<mark>$1</mark>@@=

When I want to =<mark>= some text, I add the macro inline, like so:

=I would like to {{{mark(mark this text)}}} so that it is highlighted=

But who has time to add all that markup by hand? To make it easier, I created the following function:

#+begin_src lisp
(defun jab/markregion ()
  "Add a 'mark' macro to the current region (for Hugo)"
  (interactive)
  (if (region-active-p)
      (progn
        (goto-char (region-end))
        (insert ")}}}")
        (goto-char (region-beginning))
        (insert "{{{mark("))))
#+end_src

Now, I select a region and run =M-x jab/markregion=. I may create a keybinding for it, too, but for now this is fast and easy.

Installed the [[https://github.com/ibnishak/Timimi][Timimi plugin]] for Firefox again on the ThinkPad. I've not been using [[https://rudimentarylathe.wiki][the wiki]] for daily notes, but I do like having it for, well, a wiki. Since I'm using Firefox on Linux,  {{{mark(Timimi is the simplest option)}}} for saving TiddlyWiki files.

I moved a lot of my synced files on the Mac {{{mark(out of iCloud Files)}}}.
This was mainly due to wanting them available on Linux, but also because iCloud
has been flaky lately. I'm always surprised how well [[https://syncthing.net/][Syncthing]] works, and how
easy it is to install. Previously, I'd configured it once and it ran and ran and
I'd forget it was there. You know, like Dropbox used to. So far, this time it
was even easier to set up and has been running without issue.

I'm thinking I'll reserve using [[https://jack.micro.blog][my micro.blog]] for posting images. Mostly.

Pretty happy with [[https://www.orgroam.com/][Org-roam]]. Every day I get closer to calling it and living there for my notes.

Alice and I went for our walk at 3:15 am. It's getting ridiculous. I went back to bed when we got home and now it's 6:00 am and that feels much more reasonable. I've been running on five hours sleep a night for a while now and I don't think it's good for me. I'm not 20 years old.

However, I do like to keep an eye on overall traffic and things like 404s, so I've re-installed [[https://goaccess.io/][GoAccess]] on the server so I can pop in as needed and review. GoAccess processes the server logs directly, so no need for embedded/tracking scripts.

has been flaky lately. I'm always surprised how well [[https://syncthing.net/][Syncthing]] works, and how
easy it is to install. Previously, I'd configured it once and it ran and ran and
I'd forget it was there. You know, like Dropbox used to. So far, this time it
was even easier to set up and has been running without issue.

I'm thinking I'll reserve using [[https://jack.micro.blog][my micro.blog]] for posting images. Mostly.

Pretty happy with [[https://www.orgroam.com/][Org-roam]]. Every day I get closer to calling it and living there for my notes.

Alice and I went for our walk at 3:15 am. It's getting ridiculous. I went back to bed when we got home and now it's 6:00 am and that feels much more reasonable. I've been running on five hours sleep a night for a while now and I don't think it's good for me. I'm not 20 years old.

However, I do like to keep an eye on overall traffic and things like 404s, so I've re-installed [[https://goaccess.io/][GoAccess]] on the server so I can pop in as needed and review. GoAccess processes the server logs directly, so no need for embedded/tracking scripts.

Against my better judgement, I spent the first half of yesterday continuing to try [[https://regolith-linux.org][Regolith Linux]]. Honestly, on the big monitor, with a decent mouse and keyboard, I could see a path to Linux full-time when it comes to general computing. This hit home after I'd switched back to my MacBook Pro and after a few minutes thought, "Well, this kind of sucks." I was referring to window management on macOS, and the fact that there isn't any. It's all manual and I noticed that I spend a lot of time micro-manging windows. I immediately missed the Workspaces and i3 setup in Regolith. Didn't expect that! I started to feel that after a couple more days, I would be able to have windows placed right where I want them, but without actually needing to /put/ them there. That would be cool.

And on Linux I have my beloved Emacs and a decent web browser. I have a nice terminal. I have competent file management. I have /control/.

What I don't have is a good way to handle photos. Photo management and editing on Linux is where things start to fall apart. The tools are better than I remember, but they're no match for Capture One, Photo Mechanic, Lightroom, Photoshop, etc. It's not even close, really. I like Darktable and Shotwell and Rawtherapee well enough, and they get the job done, but they're still too janky to live with all the time. In fact, I feel that way about much of Linux; it gets the job done, but there are a lot of rough edges that take the joy out of it. But just imagine if I could sand those smooth.

I woke this morning unable to stop thinking about all this-wondering. I'm writing this while sitting at the ThinkPad plugged into the big screen and learning and swearing, but feeling pretty good. This is currently classified as an "experiment".

Spending half my day yesterday installing [[https://regolith-linux.org][Regolith Linux]] on an old ThinkPad was fun, but useless. I should stop wasting my time like that.

For a time, I thought I'd stick with my Mac on the desktop and use Linux for my portable workstation. Linux is fun to tinker with. There are dozens of variations try. It's got the right philosophy about how things should work and how computing should /be/. I like having it around, but I don't like /using/ it so much.

For years I've used a desktop Mac and a MacBook. Weary of dealing with maintaining two machines and worrying about sync, configuration, etc., I recently consolidated my computers down to one Mac. It's so much better having only one machine. I now realize just how much time I'd spent managing everything. It was /a lot/. Moving to a single-computer setup has been the most productive and satisfying change I've made in years.

And yet there I was, installing Regolith because Paul Ford mentioned it on Twitter.

#+begin_export html
<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="Paul Ford on Twitter" data-author="" cite="https://twitter.com/ftrain/status/1483437985798541316">
I know no one cares but Regolith on Ubuntu + nord theme is a nice way to do a tiling window manager without plowing through a pile of Arch wiki pages where no one will tell you the default modifier key because you should set that yourself.
<footer><cite> <a href="https://twitter.com/ftrain/status/1483437985798541316">https://twitter.com/ftrain/status/1483437985798541316</a></cite></footer>

#+end_export

That's all it took. I thought, "Hey, that looks neat, I should throw it on the old ThinkPad!" So I did. And Paul was right. It was nice.

I'm infatuated with tiling window managers, and Regolith takes a neat approach to merging [[https://i3wm.org][i3]] and "regular" Ubuntu. I plugged it into my 32" monitor, where a window manager shines. I thought, "I could learn to live like this."

But, after a few hours, all of the little inconsistencies begin to show. I start to miss the little quality-of-life touches that I take for granted on macOS. I once again need to concern myself with sync. And oh, the new MacBook Pro M1 Pro Max is a glorious piece of hardware (and software). Unmatched, as far as I know.

One day I may go all-in on Linux. That's the only way it could work for me. That day is not today, so I need to stop spending too much time thinking it might be.

I don't understand the need for "writing prompts". Unless writing is your job, or you're working on a book, if you don't feel like writing, maybe just don't write and stop worrying about it?

I've been thinking about killing Roon and moving to Apple Music. But I have a lifetime license to Roon, so that's weird. The trouble is that Roon doesn't work for me unless it's also connected to Qobuz, which costs me $15/month.

Currently, I pay for Qobuz, Spotify, and Apple Music. That's nuts. Qobuz is fine, but it's no longer the only decent Hi-Res option in town. I've never liked Spotify, but I have family that lives there. I have an Apple One family account, so I'm already paying for everyone to have Music.

Apple Music is not a great app and it's not the smartest streaming service, but I get it with the rest of the Apple One subscription, so that's where I'm headed.

I'm just going to have to bite the bullet and wean everyone from Spotify. And I'm going to have to wean myself from the wonders of Roon, for streaming, at least. Roon still works great with my local music library.

So, I'm not actually leaving Roon. I'm leaving Qobuz, but the effect will be similar.

What do I get in return for all the time and thought I put into taking notes? I
mean, I put a /lot/ of thought into it. What's in it for me? For example, I've been
meticulously recording my meals since December. I can tell you how many times I
ate fast food or had pancakes for breakfast. Big whoop! There is almost zero
lingering value in doing it other than that it's neat. Is "neat" enough to
justify the effort it took to set up the logging process and the ongoing effort
of recording every meal? It's fun to set up, but if I'm honest, it's not useful.

How cool would it be to have all my stuff in one place (that's not Emacs)? It solves the related problem of public vs private notes. Using Tinderbox makes it easy to publish only what I want, where I want. I can also pull in parts of private outlines and notes into the published areas. Hmmm.

That does it. I'm creating a brand new Tinderbox document with the intention of combining my Daybook and Blog documents for 2022. This will work nicely as a way to avoid doing anything actually useful today. I may never actually /use/ it, but building it should be fun.

I have a hunch that paying the log4j team would not have prevented the exploit. The idea that "big companies" should pay open-source developers is fine, but expecting it to work in real life is, at best, optimistic. First, the people actually able to cut checks are far removed from the dev team who actually know which OSS packages are in use. Second, how many of those likely dozens or hundreds of packages should be paid for and how much and who keeps track of them? I can imagine the big, obvious ones maybe getting some attention, but things like log4j never hit the radar. Maybe there could be some sort of audit system, but still feels unlikely.

Day 2 of my Rails project build. I have a long way to go, and a lot to learn before I get there. Some of it still rings a bell, though.

How am I supposed to know what I'm good at if I never actually /do/ anything?

I thought I'd see what the [[https://rubyonrails.org][Ruby On Rails]] world looked like with version 7 being released recently. I haven't written anything in Rails since like 2010. Here's the very first fucking thing that happened:

After much thrashing about the past two days, I've again settled on Lightroom Classic for photo management. I want to use Capture One because I get to better images faster. I want to use Lightroom Desktop because it's fast and pretty and syncs everywhere. But, Classic gives me every tool I could ever need in a complete, widely-supported package. It's got everything going for it. It doesn't bring me joy, but it gets the job done and leaves me all the options I need.

Still trying [[https://www.raycast.com/][Raycast]] as an Alfred replacement. If I can find a solution/replacement for Alfred's "Universal Actions" I'll be a convert.

Well bonjour to you too!

My wife just passed 6,000 miles on her exercise bike. Amazing.

I'm deploying this using a Raycast [[https://github.com/raycast/script-commands][Script Command]]. If this works well, I may no longer need Fastscripts.

It's really nice not having to think, "I need to remember to do this on the other Mac." after every configuration change or app install I make on the new MBP. One machine is the right answer.

It took me all of 2 minutes to stop seeing the notch on the new MBP. It's a non-issue, although I am being more diligent about making sure apps don't show an icon in the menu bar unless it's necessary.

I think I'll live with the little 14-inch screen for a spell before hooking this thing up to the 32-inch monitor. For normal writing, browsing, etc. a small screen is kind of calming. I don't expect this feeling to last, but it's fun for now.

One thing for sure is that Lightroom Classic isn't nearly as pleasant on a smaller screen as Lightroom Desktop (my god how could they have messed up the product naming so badly?). It's making me think about running with Desktop again.

The maintainer of Org-roam has made comments lately making me think he's barely even using it. There are a few other active contributors but it still makes me uneasy. Guess I'll need to figure out for real how to use Org-roam and Logseq together.

I scanned a roll of 35mm film with the Epson 750 and have decided the scan quality is plenty good enough for me. I'll sell the PrimeFilm scanner.

I took 140 photos with the M10-R at an office Christmas party last night. I culled things down to 47 images worth sharing with the group. Here's one of the cool Cadillac that was parked in the room.

I've been trying to use Lightroom Desktop (not Classic) but I don't think I can do it. It's fast, lightweight, and handles storage and backups and everything for me. Some days I don't feel like naming, managing, and dealing with files. On the other hand, I can never get comfortable with /not/ managing them. But mostly it's that Lightroom Classic does everything /except/ manage the actual photos. I need that more than I need the convenience.

It's like every morning I'm a completely different person.

I've been watching the UPS tracker all day. The MBP was unexpectedly in town by 9:00 am this morning. I was still waiting for the status to change to "Out for Delivery" but it never did. Then, the doorbell rang! ü•≥

It occurs to me that optimizing for speed of setting up a new computer is a waste of so much time. How often does the average person need to bootstrap a new computer? Right, not very often. Having 2 machines makes the effort a little more valuable, since often the setup stuff is then synced. But now that I'm about to be down to a single computer, I'm not going to worry about it at all.

Maybe I'll take that back. It's been three hours and I have the broad strokes done on the new MBP. But I know there are soooo many loose ends I have yet to trip over.

I miss Ruby on Rails. I deployed my first production Rails app for a client in 2007. This may have been before Rails was even out of beta. It was a joyful time. With version 7.0.0 released yesterday ([[https://rubyonrails.org/2021/12/15/Rails-7-fulfilling-a-vision][Ruby on Rails ‚Äî Rails 7.0: Fulfilling a vision]]), I think I'll see what I've missed in the last decade or so. Node, React, SPAs, and friends never felt right to me. Rails felt right, but our developers wanted to move on. A few of them are now back doing Rails full-time. Maybe I'll join them!

The good news is that my new MBP has finally moved from Shanghai to Alaska. The bad news is that now it's not scheduled to arrive until Monday.

I've updated my Emacs config so that Org mode is prettier. I really just wanted prettier bullets. I learned that when using [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][Doom Emacs]], one can add =+pretty= to org's config in init.el to get nice bullets. I've tweaked mine further, like so:

I changed the theme again at [[https://baty.blog][baty.blog]]. Back to "Saima". I still like Casper, but wanted something that felt lighter. Cleaner. Hoping Saimi can stay, but I'm always looking.

There's a small chance that I'll move this site from daily.baty.net to baty.blog and move baty.blog to copingmechanism.com. I used daily.baty.net while experimenting with the idea of using Hugo for the daily notes. Turns out I like it, so I'm thinking about a permanent home.

I've been trying [[https://www.raycast.com/][Raycast]] and it has some neat ideas. I'm not sure yet if it's better than [[https://www.alfredapp.com][Alfred]], but it's fun to try a new approach to what for me has become workflow plumbing.

I should start a new site at weekly.baty.net where I summarize everything from here and [[https://rudimentarylathe.wiki][the wiki]] and the blog (ahem, blogs). It might also make for a sustainable and mildly interesting newsletter.

What if I were to start thinking of all my blogs and wikis and streams and such as projects? This site is my "Daily Notes" project. I have a "Wiki Project" over at [[https://rudimentarylathe.org][rudimentarylathe.wiki]]. I also like the word "experiment" but I'm thinking "project" has a more bite-sized and tangible ring to it, somehow.

Well, shit, now this "projects" idea has taken hold of me. Update: I started poking around looking for ideas and found [[https://tinyprojects.dev/][Tiny Projects]] by Ben Stokes. He also made [[https://paperwebsite.com/][Paper Website: Start a tiny website from your notebook]], which is the coolest idea and I'm pissed I didn't think of it. That's /exactly/ the kind of thing I'm thinking about

Well, neat, Emacs is crashing again whenever I save and export from ox-hugo. I've tried disabling the bit that exports automatically every time the file is saved: =# eval: (org-hugo-auto-export-mode)=. Maybe it's got something to do with the auto-export function. I could just punt and edit these posts as individual Markdown files but Markdown isn't Org now is it? Update: So far, so good on doing the exports manually. It's a few more keystrokes (=C-c C-e H H=), but not a huge burden.

Now I've been poking around in [[https://static.baty.net][static.baty.net]] and ran into my 10-year-old [[https://dellibrary.baty.net/][Jack Baty's Delicious Library]] site. I update the photo of me while I was in there.

I think I've started writing here again because it's the kind of blog I'd want to read. The wiki isn't. I wish more people would write blogs like this one. I'd read 'em üòÅ.

Would I run this site if there were an easy, self-hosted version of [[http://drummer.scripting.com][Drummer]]? I might!

+I've moved this site from Cloudflare Pages to my static Digital Ocean droplet running [[https://caddyserver.com][Caddy]]. I just use a [[https://github.com/jackbaty/daily.baty.net/blob/main/Makefile][Makefile]] to commit the changes and push them out to the server. No delays. No build limits. Mine.+

Never mind. Cloudflare gets me hosting, analytics, speed reports, and a CDN for free. The downside is a little complexity and short wait between pushing and seeing changes live. A fair trade, for now.

In an effort to stay focused and actually move toward specific goals, I've started clocking my time in Org mode again. This means the first two hours I logged were under "Configuring Emacs".

For all the time and energy I spend on my <mark>logging system(s)</mark>, it's embarrassing how infrequently I actually use them to look things up. What's even the point? I wonder if my overall happiness would improve if I just stopped doing it. Jot down a few crucial details during the week and let the river of time wash away the rest.

Today, I'm thinking that [[https://logseq.com][Logseq]] offers the best friction to value ratio, while still being local-first and plain text. It's dead-simple to add notes and offers nice backlinks and graphing. The graph is unnecessary but is a free byproduct, so why not? It beats Roam for privacy, cost, and attitude. It beats TiddlyWiki for ease of use and usefulness outside of the app. Plus, the files are in Org format. What's not to like?

Yeah, the contradiction of the two previous paragraphs is not lost on me.

As much as I love the idea of the [[https://johnnydecimal.com][Johnny.Decimal]] system, I've utterly failed at maintaining mine.

[[https://linkingmanifesto.org/][Linking Manifesto ‚Äì Manifesto for Ubiquitous Linking]] seems useful, but how does it go anywhere?

My mood this week is one of removing the necessity, nay, the /ability/ to customize and configure the apps I use to do stuff. For some reason, I've not been tweaking my Emacs config much, so that's a relief. Back to Things, then?

Oh joy, <mark>Emacs crashes</mark> every time I save this file. I'm editing it in [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html) right now... TAKE THAT EMACS! Ok, now I'm testing to see if it's related to the automatic saving/exporting in ox-hugo. Hmm, seems to be. If I edit (in Emacs) the markdown file directly, all is well. So now what?

I haven't taken enough photos with them yet, but they sure look pretty just sitting there waiting for me.

The rest will just flow top-to-bottom above that. Let's see how it feels.

I take photos with very <mark>fancy cameras</mark> and do some detailed edit work in Lightroom. I often message these photos to family or friends.

Speaking of newsletters, now that I've been using a "blog" for my daily notes, it occurred to me that this format could also work as a daily-ish email newsletter. Have to think about that. Would anyone be interested in an email version of this blog, copy and pasted daily into [[https://thelathe.substack.com/][my Substack newsletter]]?

At some point I'm going to need to add search here, somehow.

I'm thinking about not installing (and hence not subscribing to) [[https://setapp.com][Setapp]] once the new machine arrives. Here are the Setapp apps I still have installed:

#+caption: Setapp apps on my Macs
[[/img/2021/20211204-setapp.png]]

Of those, I don't use Path Finder unless I need a quick directory comparison. There are other tools for that, but I'm lazy. I rarely use Gemini, or Better Touch Tool. I use Emacs instead of MetaImage. I already own a standalone license for Forklift, which is indispensable. The apps I'll need to buy/license are:

CleanMyMac, $34.95/year. I use this weekly and love it. There's an option to buy a license outright for
CleanShot X $29 one time. Far and away the best screenshot tool. I use it all day.
HoudahSpot, $0. I own a license. Way better than using Spotlight for search.
TablePlus, $69 one time. Favorite database management tool. I don't use it often, so this may not be necessary.

That is a one-time payment of $98 plus a couple bucks a month for CleanMyMac. If I skip TablePlus the one-time amount drops to $29.

So after a few months I'm down from $9.99/month for Setapp with access to more than a hundred apps, to just shy of $3.00/month for one app and I own one or two others outright. That extra $7.00/month gives me access to a nearly bottomless well of utilities and toys. I don't think the savings is worth what I'm giving up. Seems I've convinced myself to continue paying for Setapp.

No doubt I'll be spending the day with the new camera. Both the camera and lens sure are pretty.

I love how most of the things I buy are meant to help me "simplify".

Any reviewer who includes "No auto-focus" as a "Con" has no business reviewing a Leica M.

Doing my best to ignore this: [[https://www.craft.do/s/lEjdSXBpq9jSgg][2.0 - Craft update]]. Thing about Craft is that it's a fantastic app but feels too "heavy" for me. Like I'm always /working/ on writing instead of just writing.

Do you ever tire of organizing things on the computer? Folders, documents, photos, and on and on. I'm sure tired of it.

Making fun of people or things publicly is a chickenshit move and seems to be the raison d'etre of most people on social media lately.

I've been using [[https://alfred.camera/][Alfred Camera | Simple Security at Your Fingertips]] with an old iPhone 6 as a front door camera. The free version was good enough (one camera, one viewer, limited features) but suddenly the app became riddled with obnoxious ads. I can pay $16.99 for no ads or subscribe for $3.99/month to get no ads plus the extra features. Maybe I should research a privacy-conscious, local-first DIY solution.

I was hoping to spend some time away from the computer today, but instead got sucked into watching videos about and around the M10-R and Summilux 35mm. Then I watched more about photography in general. Then I realized that 80% of YouTube channels are crap content factories, publishing for the sake of publishing and have long ago run out of interesting things to say. So, basically, I've wasted most of the day. I did get a haircut, so at least I'm devastatingly handsome.

I remain very much undecided about keeping this daily blog in Org mode or moving it back into TiddlyWiki. If anyone is reading this and has an opinion, I'd love to hear from you. The thing about the wiki is it's always right there in my browser and it's already done. No need to configure/tweak/change much ever. There's something to that. On the other hand, this blog is managed in a single org mode outline and is published to a nice-looking blog with RSS and everything. It's "normal", which seems like it would be better suited to casual readers. So...yeah.

Made a small donation to [[https://archive.org/][Internet Archive]]. You might consider doing the same. It's a precious resource.

I almost left the MP sitting on a table at the restaurant last night. What an idiot. I don't deserve nice things.

Still waffling about splitting these daily notes out of the wiki. This is mostly because I got into a lazy mood yesterday in which I stopped wanting to work to maintain anything. This blog doesn't require effort to maintain all the time, but there's a lot going on in support of it. If any part of that breaks down, I'm going to lose interest quickly. Another aspect is that when I was doing this in the wiki, /everything/ was in the wiki. That's kind of nice. One big HTML file with it all right there. This blog has everything in one big org outline, which is nice, but in order to get a usable, parsable website out of it, it needs to be rendered. The wiki /is already/ a fully functional website. I like that part of it.

I'm supposed to journal and blog as ways to write about what I'm thinking and feeling, but I too often instead write about /writing about/ what I'm thinking and feeling.

I hesitate to publicly compliment people because so much of social media is people blowing smoke up the asses of others for attention. That's not what I'm doing when I compliment someone. This is why I often send a (private) email instead.

Progressive Rock, NWOBHM, and pre-Nu Metal are the best genres of music.

Maintaining the blog and the wiki is kind of unnecessary, but I do like the clean, tidy, mobile-friendly rendering of this theme. And I like writing in Org and Emacs. One decision yet to be made is whether to stop the Daily Notes completely on the wiki, and just point out any significant new content from here. Or who knows, I could end up back all-in TiddlyWiki. Wouldn't be the first time. I'm having fun right now, though.

I'm pretty much over trying to manage email in either mutt or mu4e. I just sent a long note to someone using Mu4e and the formatting was terrible, mostly around line breaks (there weren't any). Looked good in Emacs though! I don't care enough to fight it. Mail.app it is.

So far, having the Q2 in a box is not disturbing at all. In fact, it's a relief.

Keyboards don't need to be wireless, but mice sure do.

I wish Safari's pinned tabs persisted across tab groups.

The built-in Weather app on iOS is good enough. I can probably delete the 35 other weather-related apps I've installed.

The Friday after Thanksgiving used to be one of the best days of the year, but after being on sabbatical for so long, it feels like just another day. And an annoying one, since everyone and their brother is out shopping so I'll need to avoid going anywhere at all today.

I'm still thinking about consolodating my 2 Macs into one new MBP. Last night, Fish shell kept throwing errors on the Air, even though it uses the same config as the Mini. The fact that I need to worry about syncing the configs is another reason for this line of reasoning. I'm so tired of managing the environment in two places. Another solution is to use stock Apple apps like Notes and friends and just let things take care of themselves but we all know that won't happen. Another aspect of this is that when I've nothing specific to do, a 32-inch monitor is rife with distractions. I can usually see a half-dozen app windows at once. Any of which could distract me at any moment. The thing is too big to maximize windows.

The worst part about blogging with something like Hugo via text files is that when I read something on the website and want to edit it, I have to go way over into another app, find the file, edit, and republish. Where in something like TiddlyWiki or Ghost I can simply click the edit button. Even Drummer is just a browser tab away from the actual thing.

To add a Drummer-inspired image floating down the right side of a paragraph (like the Hugo logo above), do this...

Oh, and [[https://orgmode.org][Org mode]] kicks Markdown's ass all the way down the street and back.

I love that this place is 100% mine. I can host it where and how I like. I can modify it if and when I like. I decide what goes where and how it gets there. There's something to be said for all this, even though it's a little more work up front. A fair trade-off. The only part I don't have complete control over right now is hosting. I'm using Cloudflare Pages via Github so I suppose they could muck things up, but I'm not worried about it because everything is local-first and I can simply push it out to a tiny VPS anywhere and I'm back in action.

I've started posting directly to Twitter and/or Mastodon rather than posting to Micro.blog first and having it cross-post for me. I like deciding what goes where and whether it needs minor changes to wording, etc. I also don't feel the need for an actual microblog any more.

I've removed the dayname from each post's "slug" because I want to be able to hack the URL by putting in a date and don't want to need to know what day that date was on. So we're back to =/2021-11-25/=. Sorry if I broke any links.

I've also added date/author info to the bottom of individual posts. I like seeing the date and time a post was last modified. The theme came with author and License stuff built-in, so I kept that, too.

I boxed up the Q2 today. I'm just testing the waters to see if I miss it. If I don't, I'm going to trade up to an M10-P (again).

06:41 Since I'm writing this in an Emacs buffer, it feels more natural to add my notes from the top down rather than reverse-chronologically. Should I timestamp each note like I did this one? (*A:* No, I don't like it.)

Sorry if today's notes become awash in Emacs minutiae. I'm working this out. There's no question that I /much/ prefer writing in Emacs than a text area in TiddlyWiki or the Drummer outliner.

Good grief, Soulver is such a great app. I've used it for years and almost forget it's not built-in. [[https://soulver.app/][Soulver 3 - Notepad Calculator App for Mac]]

I need to decide on permalinks. Currently, they are /YYYY-MM-DD (=:slug= in Hugo). The files are actually rendered into yearly folders e.g. =YYYY/YYYY-MM-DD.md=. The duplicate year bugs me a little. Perhaps I should go with something easier to read for the slug, like =YYYY/MM-DD-Weekday.md=. Today's would be "/2021/11-24-Wednesday". After thinking about it, I am going without the fake year subfolder but am adding the weekday because I like knowing that without having to look it up. Settled!

The free version of Cloudflare Pages is limited to 500 "builds" per month. That means I can re-render this blog 10 times a day and still have plenty left. I bet I push the wiki at least that many times, so I do need to be a little careful. Worst case I just move the whole enterprise to a static site on my server and rsync to my heart's content.

I'm having a hard time getting comfortable using iCloud drive for syncing everything. I've already moved ~/org out since paths get wonky even when using symlinks to fake them. The iCloud process has hung twice recently. A sync solution can be slow, or weird, but what it can't be is unreliable.

I have been unable to play from Roon to the KEF LSX speakers for nearly a week. I've tried everything I can think of. I'm no using AirPlay from the Apple Music app. Not ideal, but at least it works.

There are several ways to approach images in ox-hugo. I'm trying three of them in this post :). First, I drag and drop an image into the buffer and it's automatically, via org-attach, moved into ./attach/XX/UUIDfilename.jpg. A link is inserted and when rendering markdown, it uses Hugo's "figure" short code. This is the easiest option to do, but has the most moving parts. I don't like that I don't have control over the precise path. Second, I just link to the URL of an image in SmugMug. Super easy, but I do have to upload the image then grab the "share" link. Not bad. The third option is to generate a local file link like =[[img/foo.jpg]]=.  This feels the most self-contained and tidy, but means exporting a specifically-sized image, naming it something, copying that name, and moving it into the static/img/etc. folder. I'll probably try all three ways for a bit to see which feels best.

I've been having a lot of fun in the darkroom lately.
