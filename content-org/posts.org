☀️ Clear +37°F

Good morning. It's 5:55 am and this morning's walk was pleasant and uneventful. Very dark.

06:41 Since I'm writing this in an emacs buffer, it feels more natural to add my notes from the top down rather than reverse-chronologic. Should I timestamp each note like I did this one? (*A:* No, I don't like it.)

Sorry if today's notes become awash in Emacs minutiae. I'm working this out. There's no question that I /much/ prefer writing in Emacs than a text area in TiddlyWiki.

There are several ways to approach images in ox-hugo. I'm trying three of them in this post :). First, I drag and drop an image into the buffer and it's automatically, via org-attach, moved into ./attach/XX/UUIDfilename.jpg. A link is inserted and when rendering markdown, it uses Hugo's "figure" short code. This is the easiest option to do, but has the most moving parts. I don't like that I don't have control over the precise path. Second, I just link to the URL of an image in SmugMug. Super easy, but I do have to upload the image then grab the "share" link. Not bad. The third option is to generate a local file link like =[[img/foo.jpg]]=.  This feels the most self-contained and tidy, but means exporting a specifically-sized image, naming it something, copying that name, and moving it into the static/img/etc. folder. I'll probably try all three ways for a bit to see which feels best.

I've been having a lot of fun in the darkroom lately.

Blogging with Drummer feels like using someone else's bathroom. I really have to go, and it's a nice bathroom, but it's not mine and I can't really relax, ya know?

I was cleaning up some old files and ran into a folder full of Org mode files that had at one time generated my Hugo-based blog.

In the folder is a file named "posts.org" which is an Org mode file, thus is basically an outline that renders out as a blog. Same as [[http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/about.opml][Drummer]]!
