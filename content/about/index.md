I created this site as a place to write down the things I'm thinking about throughout each day. It's meant as a replacement for the "Daily Notes" entries on [my wiki](https://rudimentarylathe.wiki).

There isn't a topic, or trend, or brand, or goal here.

**Do not expect consistency**.

There's a "landing page" at [baty.net](https://www.baty.net/) (thanks to [omg.lol](https://omg.lol))

My wiki is [rudimentarylathe.wiki](https://rudimentarylathe.wiki)
