☁️ Overcast +25°F

Good morning. It's 4:20 am and when do you think I'll be able to get 8 hours sleep?

I'm still planning to spend at least a few hours each day this week on my little Rails project. So far it's not clicking for me. I'm in the must-look-up-every-single-thing phase and it's exhausting.

For someone who's recently claimed that "owning" and managing music was no longer interesting, I'm sure spending a lot of time today editing metadata of my local library in Roon.
