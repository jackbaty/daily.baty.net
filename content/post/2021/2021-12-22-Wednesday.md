☁️ Overcast +25°F

Good morning. It's 4:20 am and when do you think I'll be able to get 8 hours sleep?

I'm still planning to spend at least a few hours each day this week on my little Rails project. So far it's not clicking for me. I'm in the must-look-up-every-single-thing phase and it's exhausting.

For someone who's recently claimed that "owning" and managing music was no longer interesting, I'm sure spending a lot of time today editing metadata of my local library in Roon.

<p>But what’s really striking about the data is the <em>distribution</em> of users across the instances. In the federation fantasy, given 3,070 instances, we hope that 50% of the user base is spread across 1,535 instances, and the other 50% across the other 1535 instances. That is, in fantasy land, every instance would host an equal number of users (642).</p>
<p>In reality, guess how many instances encompass half of the user base. Maybe 1,000? Alright, there are some big instances in there, so perhaps 100? Well, there are a lot of really tiny instances mixed in, so possibly only 20?</p>
<p>The answer?</p>
<p><strong>Three</strong>.</p>
<p>Just <em>three</em> instances encompass 50.8% of users.</p>

I want to be the kind of person who says, "I'm not on social media", but instead I'm the kind of person who says "I want to be the kind of person who says, 'I'm not on social media.'"

Tell me what you're interested in and what you think about things. Don't tell me what you think other people should do or be interested in.
