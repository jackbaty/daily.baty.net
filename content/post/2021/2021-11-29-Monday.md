☁️ Overcast +32°F

I remain very much undecided about keeping this daily blog in Org mode or moving it back into TiddlyWiki. If anyone is reading this and has an opinion, I'd love to hear from you. The thing about the wiki is it's always right there in my browser and it's already done. No need to configure/tweak/change much ever. There's something to that. On the other hand, this blog is managed in a single org mode outline and is published to a nice-looking blog with RSS and everything. It's "normal", which seems like it would be better suited to casual readers. So...yeah.

Made a small donation to [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/). You might consider doing the same. It's a precious resource.

I made a few counter offers to the trade-in values of some gear I'm giving up. Waiting to hear back from Ben. If it's good, I'm going to have a new Leica M (Digital) and fancy lens soon.

I see [@jack has resigned](https://twitter.com/jack/status/1465347002426867720) as CEO of Twitter. I've been mostly OK with him over the years. I'm mildly interested in what others think, but not enough to listen to 27 million hot takes by 27 million newly-minted experts in whatever field they think this falls under.

I'm trying hard to not be one of those people who are bitter and cynical about everything. I think it's working, but it's definitely uphill. Based on my social media feeds, most people don't make it. (Or aren't even trying.)

Don't assume you know the motivations of others...people or companies. You don't.

I am about to be the owner of a Leica M10-R with 35mm Summilux-M FLE. Wow. I had to give up the Q2, 35mm Summicron-M ASPH, 35mm APO Summicron-SL, and my M4 to cover it. We'll see how it feels in a few days!
