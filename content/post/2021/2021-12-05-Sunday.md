After four hours of flailing about, I've decided to give up on running [Photoprism](https://photoprism.app) on the Synology. While I did get it to work at one point, it was so slow to index anything as to be unusable. And conversion of DNG files seemed to get stuck and I needed to reboot the whole machine. It just felt too abstracted and fragile, so I'm looking at Synology Photos again.
