☀️ Clear +37°F

Good morning. It's 5:55 am and this morning's walk was pleasant and uneventful. Very dark.

06:41 Since I'm writing this in an emacs buffer, it feels more natural to add my notes from the top down rather than reverse-chronologic. Should I timestamp each note like I did this one? (**A:** No, I don't like it.)

Sorry if today's notes become awash in Emacs minutiae. I'm working this out. There's no question that I _much_ prefer writing in Emacs than a text area in TiddlyWiki.
