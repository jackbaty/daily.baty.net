☀️ Clear +33°F

I took 140 photos with the M10-R at an office Christmas party last night. I culled things down to 47 images worth sharing with the group. Here's one of the cool Cadillac they had parked in the room.

I've been trying to use Lightroom Desktop (not Classic) but I don't think I can do it. It's fast, lightweight, and handles storage and backups and everything for me. Some days I don't feel like naming, managing, and dealing with files. On the other hand, I can never get comfortable with _not_ managing them. But mostly it's that Lightroom Classic does everything _except_ manage the actual photos. I need that more than I need the convenience.
