‚òÄÔ∏è Clear +33¬∞F

I took 140 photos with the M10-R at an office Christmas party last night. I culled things down to 47 images worth sharing with the group. Here's one of the cool Cadillac that was parked in the room.

I've been trying to use Lightroom Desktop (not Classic) but I don't think I can do it. It's fast, lightweight, and handles storage and backups and everything for me. Some days I don't feel like naming, managing, and dealing with files. On the other hand, I can never get comfortable with _not_ managing them. But mostly it's that Lightroom Classic does everything _except_ manage the actual photos. I need that more than I need the convenience.

It's like every morning I'm a completely different person.

I've been watching the UPS tracker all day. The MBP was unexpectedly in town by 9:00 am this morning. I was still waiting for the status to change to "Out for Delivery" but it never did. Then, the doorbell rang! ü•≥

It occurs to me that optimizing for speed of setting up a new computer is a waste of so much time. How often does the average person need to bootstrap a new computer? Right, not very often. Having 2 machines makes the effort a little more valuable, since often the setup stuff is then synced. But now that I'm about to be down to a single computer, I'm not going to worry about it at all.

Maybe I'll take that back. It's been three hours and I have the broad strokes done on the new MBP. But I know there are soooo many loose ends I have yet to trip over.
