⛅️  Partly cloudy +65°F

It's 65 degrees this morning, and _very_ windy. Felt like spring, a little.

I miss Ruby on Rails. I deployed my first production Rails app for a client in 2007. This may have been before Rails was even out of beta. It was a joyful time. With version 7.0.0 released yesterday ([Ruby on Rails — Rails 7.0: Fulfilling a vision](https://rubyonrails.org/2021/12/15/Rails-7-fulfilling-a-vision)), I think I'll see what I've missed in the last decade or so. Node, React, SPAs, and friends never felt right to me. Rails felt right, but our developers wanted to move on. A few of them are now back doing Rails full-time. Maybe I'll join them!

The good news is that my new MBP has finally moved from Shanghai to Alaska. The bad news is that now it's not scheduled to arrive until Monday.

I've updated my Emacs config so that Org mode is prettier. I really just wanted prettier bullets. I learned that when using [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs), one can add `+pretty` to org's config in init.el to get nice bullets. I've tweaked mine further, like so:

```elisp
(setq
    org-superstar-headline-bullets-list '("⁖" "◉" "○" "✸" "✿"))
```

I changed the theme again at [baty.blog](https://baty.blog). Back to "Saima". I still like Casper, but wanted something that felt lighter. Cleaner. Hoping Saimi can stay, but I'm always looking.

There's a small chance that I'll move this site from daily.baty.net to baty.blog and move baty.blog to copingmechanism.com. I used daily.baty.net while experimenting with the idea of using Hugo for the daily notes. Turns out I like it, so I'm thinking about a permanent home.

The kind of photos I want to make are portraits: studio or environmental. Why, then, do I have fancy Leica M cameras when there are much more suitable cameras for the task?

I haven't bought any clothes in a long time. Got a new cardigan this week.
