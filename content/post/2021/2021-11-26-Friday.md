I like to be seen, but I don't like to be watched. It seems like half the houses in my neighborhood have Ring doorbells and it makes me uncomfortable while walking the dog.

So far, having the Q2 in a box is not disturbing at all. In fact, it's a relief.

Keyboards don't need to be wireless, but mice sure do.

I wish Safari's pinned tabs persisted across tab groups.

The built in Weather app on iOS is good enough. I can probably delete the 35 other weather-related apps I've installed.

The Friday after Thanksgiving used to be one of the best days of the year. After being on sabbatical for so long, it's just another day. And an annoying one, since everyone and their brother is out shopping so I'll need to avoid going anywhere at all today.
