There are several ways to approach images in ox-hugo. I'm trying three of them in this post :). First, I drag and drop an image into the buffer and it's automatically, via org-attach, moved into ./attach/XX/UUIDfilename.jpg. A link is inserted and when rendering markdown, it uses Hugo's "figure" short code. This is the easiest option to do, but has the most moving parts. I don't like that I don't have control over the precise path. Second, I just link to the URL of an image in SmugMug. Super easy, but I do have to upload the image then grab the "share" link. Not bad. The third option is to generate a local file link like `[[img/foo.jpg]]`.  This feels the most self-contained and tidy, but means exporting a specifically-sized image, naming it something, copying that name, and moving it into the static/img/etc. folder. I'll probably try all three ways for a bit to see which feels best.

I've been having a lot of fun in the darkroom lately.

Blogging with Drummer feels like using someone else's bathroom. I really have to go, and it's a nice bathroom, but it's not mine and I can't really relax, ya know?


## ox-hugo feels a lot like Drummer {#ox-hugo-feels-a-lot-like-drummer}

I was cleaning up some old files and ran into a folder full of Org mode files that had at one time generated my Hugo-based blog.

In the folder is a file named "posts.org" which is an Org mode file, thus is basically an outline that renders out as a blog. Same as [Drummer](http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/about.opml)!
