Remember that time I used the guy in this photo as my avatar? (More in [Found Negatives](https://static.baty.net/galleries/found-negatives/))

I've been trying [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) and it has some neat ideas. I'm not sure yet if it's better than [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com), but it's fun to try a new approach to what for me has become workflow plumbing.

I should start a new site at weekly.baty.net where I summarize everything from here and [the wiki](https://rudimentarylathe.wiki) and the blog (ahem, blogs). It might also make for a sustainable and mildly interesting newsletter.

What if I were to start thinking of all my blogs and wikis and streams and such as projects? This site is my "Daily Notes" project. I have a "Wiki Project" over at [rudimentarylathe.wiki](https://rudimentarylathe.org). I also like the word "experiment" but I'm thinking "project" has a more bite-sized and tangible ring to it, somehow.

Well, shit, now this "projects" idea has taken hold of me. Update: I started poking around looking for ideas and found [Tiny Projects](https://tinyprojects.dev/) by Ben Stokes. He also made [Paper Website: Start a tiny website from your notebook](https://paperwebsite.com/), which is the coolest idea and I'm pissed I didn't think of it. That's _exactly_ the kind of thing I'm thinking about

Well, neat, Emacs is crashing again whenever I save and export from ox-hugo. I've tried disabling the bit that exports automatically every time the file is saved: `# eval: (org-hugo-auto-export-mode)`. Maybe it's got something to do with the auto-export function. I could just punt and edit these posts as individual Markdown files but Markdown isn't Org now is it? Update: So far, so good on doing the exports manually. It's a few more keystrokes (`C-c C-e H H`), but not a huge burden.

Now I've been poking around in [static.baty.net](https://static.baty.net) and ran into my 10-year-old [Jack Baty's Delicious Library](https://dellibrary.baty.net/) site. I update the photo of me while I was in there.

I think I've started writing here again because it's the kind of blog I'd want to read. The wiki isn't. I wish more people would write blogs like this one. I'd read 'em üòÅ.
