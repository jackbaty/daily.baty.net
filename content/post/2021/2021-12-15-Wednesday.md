ðŸŒ«  Mist +45Â°F

I've been trying [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) and it has some neat ideas. I'm not sure yet if it's better than [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com), but it's fun to try a new approach to what for me has become workflow plumbing.

I should start a new site at weekly.baty.net where I summarize everything from here and [the wiki](https://rudimentarylathe.wiki) and the blog (ahem, blogs). It might also make for a sustainable and mildly interesting newsletter.

What if I were to start thinking of all my blogs and wikis and streams and such as projects? This site is my "Daily Notes" project. I have a "Wiki Project" over at [rudimentarylathe.wiki](https://rudimentarylathe.org). I also like the word "experiment" but I'm thinking "project" has a more bite-sized and tangible ring to it, somehow.

Well, shit, now this "projects" idea has taken hold of me. Update: I started poking around looking for ideas and found [Tiny Projects](https://tinyprojects.dev/) by Ben Stokes. He also made [Paper Website: Start a tiny website from your notebook](https://paperwebsite.com/), which is the coolest idea and I'm pissed I didn't think of it
