Bed after midnight, up at 4:00 am. Good morning! ü•±

After much thrashing about the past two days, I've again settled on Lightroom Classic for photo management. I want to use Capture One because I get to better images faster. I want to use Lightroom Desktop because it's fast and pretty and syncs everywhere. But, Classic gives me every tool I could ever need in a complete, widely-supported package. It's got everything going for it. It doesn't bring me joy, but it gets the job done and leaves me all the options I need.

Still trying [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) as an Alfred replacement. If I can find a solution/replacement for Alfred's "Universal Actions" I'll be a convert.

Well bonjour to you too!

My wife just passed 6,000 miles on her exercise bike. Amazing.

I'm deploying this using a Raycast [Script Command](https://github.com/raycast/script-commands). If this works well, I may no longer need Fastscripts.

It's really nice not having to think, "I need to remember to do this on the other Mac." after every configuration change or app install I make on the new MBP. One machine is the right answer.
