☁️ Overcast +39°F

Good morning. It's 5:25 am and it feels like I have <mark>no tangible goals</mark> at all for the week ahead.

{{< figure src="/img/2021/20211206-information-diet.png" >}}

I keep thinking about <mark>running this blog as baty.blog</mark> (replacing Drummer). "daily.baty.net" is good because it explicitly indicates what the site is for. Also, it keeps me from breaking URLs and RSS feeds...again. Maybe I should just leave well enough alone.

Ever since <mark>moving the Synology</mark> to my basement office, all I hear are its drives, constantly grinding away. It's a little crazy-making. It does help remind me to turn on some music, though.

I could stare at the pegboard in my dad's garage all day.

Much like when helping run Fusionary, I want to be in charge of everything but responsible for nothing.

I put together a Blurb book today for 2021 family photos. I don't love the design, captions, or layout, but if I fuss with it too much it never gets done, so I just cranked it out in a couple hours and sent it to print.
