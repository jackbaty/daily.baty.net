Good morning. It's 5:15 am and it occurs to me that my net worth keeps going down and my weight keeps going up.

It would be better to check in and see what the world is up to maybe once a week, and spend the rest of the time being up to something myself. But what I actually do is check in with the world continuously throughout each day, leaving no time for doing anything.

Guess I'll be reloading the FedEx pages for my new camera and lens all day. FedEx says "Delivered by today" but the packages are still in Indianapolis this morning and FedEx has been wrong 90% of the time lately. Still, ðŸ¤ž

Do you ever tire of organizing things on the computer? Folders, documents, photos, and on and on. I'm sure tired of it. My [Johnny.Decimal](https://johnnydecimal.com)-based folder system is mostly in disarray and the "\_Filing Cabinet Inbox" folder is full of stuff I've yet to file. I don't feel like dealing with it. It's just busywork. I just want to pour everything into a couple of top-level folders and let HoudahSpot sort-em out as needed.

Making fun of people or things publicly is a chickenshit move and seems to be the raison d'etre of most people on social media lately.

I've been using [Alfred Camera | Simple Security at Your Fingertips](https://alfred.camera/) with an old iPhone 6 as a front door camera. The free version was good enough (one camera, one viewer, limited features) but suddenly the app became riddled with obnoxious ads. I can pay $16.99 for no ads or subscribe for $3.99/month to get no ads plus the extra features. Maybe I should research a privacy-conscious, local-first DIY solution.

The trouble with letting just anyone join is that they do.

I have a tiny urge to dismantle my Roon NUC, go back to just using streaming with Apple Music, and putting the NUC to use as, say, a Photoprism server. I just don't feel the need to "own" digital music the way I used do.

It's here!
