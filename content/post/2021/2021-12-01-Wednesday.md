Good morning. It's 5:15 am and it occurs to me that my net worth keeps going down and my weight keeps going up.

It would be better to check in and see what the world is up to maybe once a week and spend the remaining time being up to something myself. But what I actually do is check in with the world continuously throughout every day, leaving no time for doing anything myself.

Guess I'll be reloading the FedEx pages for my new camera and lens all day. FedEx says "Delivered by today" but the packages are still in Indianapolis this morning and FedEx has been wrong 90% of the time lately. Still, ðŸ¤ž
