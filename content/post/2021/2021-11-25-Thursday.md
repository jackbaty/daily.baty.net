☁️ Overcast +48°F

Good morning. It's 5:48 am and I just had nearly eight ours of uninterupted sleep. My brain is buzzing. Oh, and happy Thanksgiving, 'muricans.

The worst part about blogging with something like Hugo via text files is that when I read something on the website and want to edit it, I have to go way over into another app, find the file, edit, and republish. Where in something like TiddlyWiki or Ghost I can simply click the edit button. Even Drummer is just a browser tab away from the actual thing.

To add a Drummer-inspired image floating down the right side of a paragraph (like the Hugo logo above), do this...

```org
#+attr_html: :class imgRightMargin
[[/img/foo.jpg]]
```

The `#+attr_html:` must be directly above the image link, along with any other attributes like `#+caption:`

I must admit that having this blog and my personal (org) journal in 2 side-by-side Emacs buffers is pretty sweet.

Oh, and [Org mode](https://orgmode.org) kicks Markdown's ass all the way down the street and back.

I love that this place is 100% mine. I can host it where and how I like. I can modify it if and when I like. I decide what goes where and how it gets there. There's something to be said for all this, even though it's a little more work up front. A fair trade-off. The only part I don't have complete control over right now is hosting. I'm using Cloudflare Pages via Github so I suppose they could muck things up, but I'm not worried about it because everything is local-first and I can simply push it out to a tiny VPS anywhere and I'm back in action.

I've started posting directly to Twitter and/or Mastodon rather than posting to Micro.blog first and having it cross-post for me. I like deciding what goes where and whether it needs minor changes to wording, etc. I also don't feel the need for an actual microblog any more.

I've removed the dayname from each post's "slug" because I want to be able to hack the URL by putting in a date and don't want to need to know what day that date was on. So we're back to `/2021-11-25/`. Sorry if I broke any links.

I've also added date/author info to the bottom of individual posts. I like seeing the date and time a post was last modified. The theme came with author and License stuff built-in, so I kept that, too.

I boxed up the Q2 today. I'm just testing the waters to see if I miss it. If I don't, I'm going to trade up to an M10-P (again).
