☁️ Overcast +48°F

Good morning. It's 5:48 am and I just had nearly eight ours of uninterupted sleep. My brain is buzzing.

{{< figure src="/img/small/hugo-logo.png" class="imgRightMargin" >}}

The worst part about blogging with something like Hugo via text files is that when I read something on the website and want to edit it, I have to go way over into another app, find the file, edit, and republish. Where in something like TiddlyWiki I can simply click the edit button. Even Drummer is just a browser tab away from the real thing.

To add a Drummer-inspired image floating down the right side of a paragraph (like the Hugo logo above), do this...

```org
#+attr_html: :class imgRightMargin
[[/img/foo.jpg]]
```

The `#+attr_html:` must be directly above the image link, along with any other attributes like `#+caption:`

I must admit that having this blog and my personal (org) journal in 2 side-by-side Emacs buffers is pretty sweet.
