Every so often, [Sacha Chua](https://sachachua.com/blog) publishes a blog post full of [Emacs news](https://sachachua.com/blog/2021/12/2021-12-13-emacs-news/). Her posts are always full of cool Emacs tricks and news and no matter where I am in the Emacs pendulum, I fire it up and start tweaking. For example, I abandoned this site nearly a week ago, moving my daily notes back to [the wiki](https://rudimentarylathe.wiki), and yet here I am, in Emacs, writing this post in Org mode. And I must admit, it feels pretty good.

I went clothes shopping for the first time in forever yesterday. The good news is that I found some very nice pieces. The bad news is that it was at [A.K. Rikk's](https://akrikks.com) so I spent way too much.
