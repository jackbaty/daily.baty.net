Blogging with Drummer feels like using someone else's bathroom. I really have to go, and it's a nice bathroom, but it's not mine and I can't really relax, ya know?


## ox-hugo feels a lot like Drummer {#ox-hugo-feels-a-lot-like-drummer}

I was cleaning up some old files and ran into a folder full of Org mode files that had at one time generated my Hugo-based blog.

In the folder is a file named "posts.org" which is an Org mode file, thus is basically an outline that renders out as a blog. Same as [Drummer](http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/about.opml)!
