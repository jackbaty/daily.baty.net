☁️ Overcast +26°F

Good morning. It's 5:54 am and I have different coffee this morning and I don't love it.

I'm supposed to journal and blog as ways to write about what I'm thinking and feeling, but I too often instead write about _writing about_ what I'm thinking and feeling.

I hesitate to publicly compliment people because so much of social media is people blowing smoke up the asses of others for attention. That's not what I'm doing when I compliment someone. This is why I often send a (private) email instead.

Progressive Rock, NWOBHM, and Nu Metal are the best genres of music.
