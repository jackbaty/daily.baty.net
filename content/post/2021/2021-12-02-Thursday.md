☀️ Clear +49°F

No doubt I'll be spending the day with the new camera. Both the camera and lens sure are pretty.

I love how most of the things I buy are meant to help me "simplify".

Any reviewer who includes "No auto-focus" as a "Con" has no business reviewing a Leica M.

Doing my best to ignore this: [2.0 - Craft update](https://www.craft.do/s/lEjdSXBpq9jSgg). Thing about Craft is that it's a fantastic app but feels too "heavy" for me. Like I'm always _working_ on writing instead of just writing.

On the other hand, a few days back in [Logseq](https://logseq.com) have been very refreshing and positive.

We're what, a dozen years in, and I don't see blockchain doing anything useful in the world. Maybe next year?

Max Read questions why we even need to play along with the crypto debate:

> Why do I have to bet at all?! Why am I in this awful, ugly, unfun casino in the first place?? Is there a way out of the casino?? And if not, can I at least just get slowly tanked on free booze and annoy people with a reminder that the house always wins?

The support I just received from the Wordpress Jetpack team was outstanding. Put one in the Wordpress column.

Every Memoji looks the same.

I know it's going to be 2 or 3 weeks before the new MBP arrives, but I'm already working on moving everything local and not worrying about sync. This is going to feel so good.

Just boxed up the following as trade-ins for the M10-R and Summilux:

-   Leica Q2
-   Leica 35mm f2.0 APO Summicron SL
-   Leica 35mm f2.0 Summicron-M ASPH V1
-   Leica M4
-   Leica 50mm f2.0 Summicron-M v4

Ouch!

Finished a roll of 120 in the Hasselblad, finally. However, I didn't remember it was loaded with Delta 100 so I metered for 400 ISO film. Sooo, yeah.
