☁️ Overcast +22°F

Good morning. It's 4:15 am and I've walked a mile in the snow and now I'm wide awake.

Emacs is no longer hanging when writing the markdown files from ox-hugo. I wish I knew why. It bugged me so much yesterday that I <mark>set up a Ghost Pro account</mark> and started a blog to see if Ghost could manage daily posts. This is not a good idea, probably.

It appears I’m writing daily notes again over at [the wiki](https://rudimentarylathe.wiki)
