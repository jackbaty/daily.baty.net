My new MBP is somewhere in Shanghai and now they seem to have no idea when it will be here.

This is fun: [Quirky Art Around the World: Edinburghâ€™s Public Pencil Sharpeners](https://medium.com/afwp/quirky-art-around-the-world-edinburghs-public-pencil-sharpeners-e599784d84ee)

I posted about my scanning woes: [Too bad about the PrimeFilm XAs Scanner](https://baty.blog/2021/too-bad-about-the-primefilm-xas-scanner/).

A pet peeve of mine is when a website complains that the phone number I entered contains non-numeric characters. Computers are smart and are perfectly capable of filtering out unwanted characters and validating what's left all by themselves. Don't make me do it.
