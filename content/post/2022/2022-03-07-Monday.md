☁️   Overcast +35°F

I follow [Matt Osbourne](https://flickr.com/photos/32681588@N03/) (aka Mr. Leica) on Flickr because he plays with just about every combination of lens and camera you could think of. Also, the lovely models don't hurt. Thing is, with all the fuss about camera/lens combinations, all the images look basically the same. The biggest difference is film vs digital but otherwise I'd be hard-pressed to tell one from the other.
