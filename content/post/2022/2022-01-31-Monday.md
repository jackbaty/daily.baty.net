People who are learning are more interesting than those who claim to _know_.

Darktable can't deal with the Q2 Monochrom...no lens correction. It _needs_ lens correction. Unless I'm missing something, this is a deal-breaker. UPDATE: I found that choosing the Q2/Summilux combination seems to work. I've configured Darktable to automatically apply the setting, even though the UI yells that "Camera Not Found!".

I'm happy to do just about _anything_ that doesn't involve "working on my resume".

Hosting my static sites on a simple VPS means I never need worry about going over some "build minutes" limitation.

I started putting financial transactions in [Ledger](https://www.ledger-cli.org) again. Dodged a bullet and put it away quickly.
