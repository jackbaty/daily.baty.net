summary: I'm bringing everything under one domain

I've been feeling a need to simplify things and I've decided that one of those things is domain names. My days of hoarding domain names, just because, are drawing to a close. I don't want the hassle of managing zones and I don't need the fees.

To that end, I'm working toward moving everything to subdomains of baty.net.

I've already moved my wiki from rudimentarylathe.wiki to rl.baty.net. I considered wiki.baty.net and may still use that instead.

Next up is baty.blog. Not sure if I'll use blog.baty.net for that or not, yet.

There are several others to move, and I'll be sure to leave permanent redirects up and running at least until the domains expire. That should give Google time to catch up.

The domains I'm not sure about are the hosted services. This Write.as blog, for example. Currently, I'm thinking I'll leave them where they are, without custom domains. That makes things simpler. I lose the opportunity to “own” the URLs but, as we all know, I'm prone to breaking links. Not my greatest feature, but it's proven true.

The idea is to have as few moving parts and dependencies as is reasonable.
