In what will come as no surprise to anyone, I am considering <mark>moving daily notes back here to daily.baty.net</mark>. Why? Fair question. This time it's because I'm starting to feel like the theme at [baty.net](https://baty.net) has become a bit convoluted and therefore fragile due to trying so hard to integrate daily posts with "regular" posts. I get bored and may want to switch up my theme. This would be too much work with the current integrated theme.
