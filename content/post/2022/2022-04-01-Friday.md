‚òÅÔ∏è   Overcast +32¬∞F

I just happened to already in Emacs so I thought I'd <mark>write here for a spell</mark>. It's no joke üòâ. Which reminds me that today is the best day to stay off the internet.

{{< figure src="/img/small/org-roam.png" class="imgRightMargin" >}}

I've been publishing a few of the notes from my Org-roam database over at [notes.baty.net](https://notes.baty.net) just in case they might be useful to someone somewhere. I also like to browse them as decent-looking (read-only) HTML files instead of from within Emacs all the time. I'm using a version of the same "CodeIt" theme I used to use for baty.net. Ideally I'd list the categories on the home page rather than a list of recent posts, but Hugo's templating system is completely unfathomable to me so I'm leaving it alone for now.

After I don't even know how many years, I've <mark>canceled my Dropbox account</mark>
