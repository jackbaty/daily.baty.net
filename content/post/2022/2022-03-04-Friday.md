☀️   Clear +16°F

I spent the morning <mark>reassembling the turret</mark> on the [Focomat IIc](https://wiki.baty.net/#Leitz%20Focomat%20IIc), then attempting to print from 6x6 negatives. It's possible, but far from ideal. The head needs to be too close to the base, making for very short exposures. I'm also struggling with the autofocus mechanism, but that's probably just me. I think I'll hold off on 6x6 printing until I have the 100mm lens issue solved for real.

This makes me want to take another swing at Standard Notes: [Why so many editors? | Crafting Privacy](https://blog.standardnotes.com/33178/why-so-many-editors)
