☁️   Overcast +13°F

It's 4:00 am and we're back from our walk. I think this is a new morning record. Now what?

Thinking maybe this today:

{{< figure src="/img/2022/20220121-Q1000172.jpg" caption="<span class=\"figure-number\">Figure 1: </span>An analog pair: Olympia SM3 and Hasselblad 500C/M" >}}

I love how the [KEF LSX](https://us.kef.com/speaker/computer-speakers/lsx-wireless-music-system.html) speakers sound, a lot, but they don't work consistently with Roon. This makes me feel less badly about [Leaving Roon](https://baty.blog/2022/leaving-roon/). I'm now either using AirPlay or a stereo mini cable.

I had no idea that [Cake covered War Pigs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDJgwUeW7_k). Awesome.
