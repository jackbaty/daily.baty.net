It's happening again. I am going to experiment with using the baty.blog domain for my new Write.as blog.

This means that the RSS feed here will change to <https://baty.blog/feed/>. If you'd like to follow along, this change will take place shortly, so you'll need to update the URL in your reader. I'll move this blog to daily.baty.blog, just in case I want to keep using it.
