I've given up on configuring my Emacs setup using [Rational Emacs](https://github.com/SystemCrafters/rational-emacs) and gone back to [Doom](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs). As much as building my own config interests me, I'll never in a million years get close to the level of refinement that Doom offers. I'm better off just riding along with a "bloated" framework and focusing on _using_ Emacs instead of playing with it.

No one gets to decide whether <mark>my subjects are "worthy"</mark> of the cameras I use to photograph them.

LinkedIn is a <mark>hellhole of self-aggrandizement</mark> and ego stroking and I don't think I can participate.
