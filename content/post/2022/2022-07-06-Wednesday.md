I've given up on configuring my Emacs setup using [Rational Emacs](https://github.com/SystemCrafters/rational-emacs) and gone back to [Doom](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs). As much as building my own config interests me, I'll never in a million years get close to the level of refinement that Doom offers. I'm better off just riding along with a "bloated" framework and focusing on _using_ Emacs instead of playing with it.
