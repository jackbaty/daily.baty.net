ðŸŒ«  Mist +39Â°F

Good morning. It's 4:25 am and I should probably be doing something useful today, but so far it doesn't look like that's going to happen.

So, I replaced [baty.net](https://baty.net) with a <mark>Hugo-based version</mark> of the blog. All the content from the WordPress site has been migrated. Well, _most_ of it. Some formatting got all blowed up. This is why I swore I'd never do it again, but here we are. I just got tired of pushing up against all the _stuff_ that is WordPress.
