ðŸŒ«  Mist +39Â°F

Good morning. It's 4:25 am and I should probably be doing something useful today, but so far it doesn't look like that's going to happen.

So, I replaced [baty.net](https://baty.net) with a <mark>Hugo-based version</mark> of the blog. All the content from the WordPress site has been migrated. Well, _most_ of it. Some formatting got all blowed up. This is why I swore I'd never do it again, but here we are. I just got tired of pushing up against all the _stuff_ that is WordPress.

Ordered: [The Real Deal: The Good, The Bad and the Beautiful of a Life Behind the Camera Â« Joe McNally Photography](https://joemcnally.com/2022/04/04/the-real-deal-the-good-the-bad-and-the-beautiful-of-a-life-behind-the-camera/)

Tried [LaunchBar 6](https://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html) for a minute, just to see what was up, as it's been years. Nah, back to [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com).

[Sleeve â€” Now playing on your Desktop](https://replay.software/sleeve)

Fixed the issue with [ox-hugo failing to export subtrees](https://notes.baty.net/notes/possible-workaround-for-ox-hugo-error-during-exports/) if the file has org-roam links in it.
