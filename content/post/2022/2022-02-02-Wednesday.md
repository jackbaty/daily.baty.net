Capture One, Lightroom, Capture One, Lightroom, Darktable, Capture One, Lightroom....

One thing I'm sure I don't need is more apps.

Remember when I said that committing to using only a single (Mac) machine was the greatest thing I've done for my mental health in a long time? I do, but I've still spent the last week or more unravelling that by trying to go all-in with Linux. <mark>I just can't. Not yet</mark>. What I have learned, though, is that when I decide the time is right, I'll be _able_ to switch without too much grief.

This typewriter doesn't get enough use, but makes a nice prop at least.

OK, I've had enough. No more waffling right now. I've deleted Capture One completely. I've deleted (baby) Lightroom completely. I've shut down the ThinkPad and put it in the closet. My photos will be edited on macOS using Lightroom Classic.
