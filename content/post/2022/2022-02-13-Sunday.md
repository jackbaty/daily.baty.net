ðŸŒ¨  Light snow, mist +13Â°F

I often feel that I could run my life entirely on paper. Then I remember that this is because there's nothing much to run.

I would like to declare Sundays to be "Stay Away From Screens Day" but I know me. Also, I've been sitting at this screen since 5:00 am with no signs of leaving.
