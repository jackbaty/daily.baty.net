☀️   Clear +30°F

Good morning. It's 4:03 am and I'm already at my desk. Why?

Something <mark>cool about Emacs</mark> that I tend to forget about is putting code right in my notes and executing it from there. I don't have to remember commands or switches, because they're right there. I just hit C-c C-c and the command's output is rendered right in the file .

I wrote a post about the new IIIC: [The Kodak Retina IIIC – Jack Baty](https://baty.net/2022/the-kodak-retina-iiic/)
