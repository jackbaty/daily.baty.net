☀️   Clear +30°F

Good morning. It's 4:03 am and I'm already at my desk. Why?

Something cool about Emacs that I tend to forget about is putting code right in my notes and executing it from there. I don't have to remember commands or switches, becuase they're right there. I just hit C-c C-c and the command's output is rendered right there in the file.
