ðŸŒ¨  Light snow, mist +18Â°F

I'm having thoughts about my computing environment...Deep Thoughtsâ„¢. I'm (almost) seriously considing Linux on the desktop and iPad Pro/Mini for mobile. WHAT!? I'll probably get over this in an hour, but right now it's top of mind and feels reasonable. It's before 7:00 am so, no, I've not been drinking. What's going to ruin this is not limitations with Linux, but limitations in iOS.
