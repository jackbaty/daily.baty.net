‚õÖÔ∏è  Partly cloudy +9¬∞F

I've decided to work on my Mac today, after a few days on Linux. Apple people tend to complain a lot about the sorry state of macOS, but coming back after time away is a stark reminder of the sheer level of refinement in macOS. It's just...nice.

The [Thelio Mira](https://system76.com/desktops/thelio-mira) from System76 is tempting. I'd like to try a modern, powerful desktop machine running Linux. I mean, how else can I do a fair comparison with my MBP? üòú. So far I've avoided the temptation, because, I just bought a top-spec'd MacBook Pro, remember?
