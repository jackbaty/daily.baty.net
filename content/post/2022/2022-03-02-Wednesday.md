"Book of Boba Fett" is terrible. He should've been left as a cool, mysterious background character.

It seems I've settled on [wiki.baty.net](https://wiki.baty.net) as the wiki domain. "rl.baty.net" still works, but is discouraged.

Derek Sivers says [Write plain text files](https://sive.rs/plaintext) and I mostly agree with him. Except if the plain text format makes what you're actually doing more difficult, then don't. I'd rather have a useful document _now_ that one day, maybe, possibly, could become unreadable, than something future-proof but shitty.

I've modified things so that the home page shows the past 30 days rather than 7. Since there's no search here yet, I figure CMD-f will let you search the past month. If it's older than that, it's probably no longer valid anyway üòÜ.
