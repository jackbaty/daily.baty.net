‚òÄÔ∏è   Clear +22¬∞F

"Book of Boba Fett" is terrible. He should've been left as a cool, mysterious background character.

It seems I've settled on [wiki.baty.net](https://wiki.baty.net) as the wiki domain. "rl.baty.net" still works, but is discouraged.

Derek Sivers says [Write plain text files](https://sive.rs/plaintext) and I mostly agree with him. Except if the plain text format makes what you're actually doing more difficult, then don't. I'd rather have a <mark>useful document now</mark> even if there's a chance that one day, maybe, possibly, it could become unreadable. Future-proof-but-shitty is not my first choice.

I've modified things so that the home page <mark>shows the past 30 days</mark> rather than 7. Since there's no search here yet, I figure CMD-f will let you search the past month. If it's older than that, it's probably no longer valid anyway üòÜ.

I've <mark>removed Disqus comments</mark> from this site. No reason other than it's overhead I don't need and I rarely see any comments anyway. Whatzamatta with you people?! Send me an email or something, sheesh.

I don't usually panic when some random company I use is acquired but goddammit! [Bandcamp is Joining Epic Games ‚Äì Bandcamp Updates](https://blog.bandcamp.com/2022/03/02/bandcamp-is-joining-epic/).
