☁️   Overcast +13°F

Back on Linux this morning. I missed i3 yesterday. So far, as long as I'm not doing photo-related stuff, Regolith is working great.

My laptop is somehow (barely) picking up a local radio station and feeding it to my speakers and it's freaking me out a little.

I've gotta say, I really dislike the look of the (very trendy) Cinestill Tungsten-balanced film.
