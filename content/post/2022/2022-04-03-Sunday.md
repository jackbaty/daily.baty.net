I'm feeling the <mark>need for convenience today</mark>. Also feeling very pointy-clicky. This doesn't bode well for my current setup. It'll pass.

If I were to be described as a "<mark>Man of letters</mark>" after I'm gone, I would consider my life to have been a success. I wonder why I've not done anything in support of that.

"...takes the biscuit" is a phrase I'm definitely going to be using more.
