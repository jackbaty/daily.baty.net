I'm not even going to mention that this site is once again built using Hugo. You'll just have to figure it out on your own this time.

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="Quotebacks" data-author="Tom Critchlow and Toby Shorin" cite="<https://quotebacks.net/>">
The Quotebacks extension allows you to highlight any piece of text on the web and quickly create a squoteback. Quotes are saved to your Quoteback library and stored in your browser's local storage in simple JSON format. You can export and import quotes easily.
