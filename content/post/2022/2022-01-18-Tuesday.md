☁️   Overcast +28°F

I'm not even going to mention that this site is once again built using Hugo. You'll just have to figure it out on your own this time.

After spending way too much time trying to get blockquotes with citations to look right, I'm considering just using Quotebacks here. Like this:

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="Quotebacks" data-author="Tom Critchlow and Toby Shorin" cite="https://quotebacks.net/#about">
Quotebacks makes it easy to reference content and create dialogue with other sites by turning snippets of text into elegant, self-contained blockquote components.
<footer>Tom Critchlow and Toby Shorin<cite> <a href="https://quotebacks.net/#about">https://quotebacks.net/#about</a></cite></footer>
</blockquote>

At least I'm using a local copy of quoteback.js so that's one fewer remote dependency I guess.

I've added a [Changelog](/changelog/) to track updates to the way this site works or looks.

Found this photo of my parents. Halloween, 1971.

I wandered through national news today and was forcefully reminded that the bad guys continue to win. It's taking what little wind I have left out of my sails.

[Comparing Static Site Hosts; Which Is The Best Host For A Static Site? | Kev Quirk](https://kevq.uk/comparing-static-site-hosts-best-host-for-a-static-site) demonstrates the disappointing performance I've had using Cloudflare Pages. Right now this site is back to a bunch of files running on a VPS under Caddy.
