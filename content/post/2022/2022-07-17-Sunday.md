My wife and I strolled around the lakefront in Saugatuck yesterday. I took only the M10-R with 35mm Summilux. There were people, dogs, boats, and water everywhere. <mark>I took fewer than 20 photos and maybe 2 don't suck</mark>. I'm not sure why I bother. And I'm especially unsure why I bother with an expensive digital rangefinder. So, with some regret, I've [relisted the M10-R for sale](https://www.fredmiranda.com/forum/topic/1762243).

I've used many <mark>film emulation "presets"</mark> over the years. Since I've recently been testing DxO PhotoLab I thought I'd also test their set of presets: [DxO FilmPack - Magic of analog in the age of digital](https://www.dxo.com/dxo-filmpack/). As with most presets, they do a nice job of helping digital photos pretend to be film photos. The fatal flaw with all of these, of course, is that they are _not_ film photos. And that's why I can never get comfortable using them.
