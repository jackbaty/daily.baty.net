My wife and I strolled around the lakefront in Saugatuck yesterday. I took only the M10-R with 35mm Summilux. There were people, dogs, boats, and water everywhere. <mark>I took fewer than 20 photos and maybe 2 don't suck</mark>. I'm not sure why I bother. And I'm especially unsure why I bother with an expensive digital rangefinder. So, with some regret, I've [relisted the M10-R for sale](https://www.fredmiranda.com/forum/topic/1762243).
