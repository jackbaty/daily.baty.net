☀️ Clear +27°F

My Linux experiment continues, now that I've figured out how to process the Q2M files in Darktable. Printing sucks, I can tell you that. But, there's something about using Linux that makes me feel free. I'm not beholden to anyone. No single entity can suddenly pull the rug out from under me. That's comforting, somehow. Everything is mine to do with as I please. This is both a blessing and a curse.

I just bought a decked-out MacBook Pro (M1 Pro Max) and yet I'm writing this on a 2015 ThinkPad.

I got so tired of logging books that I just stopped reading. There, fixed!
