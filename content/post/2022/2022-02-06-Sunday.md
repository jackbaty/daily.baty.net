☀️   Clear +18°F

I'm tired this morning.

There are several apps that make me never want to leave macOS, and one of those is [Curio](https://www.zengobi.com/curio/).

My paper journal morphs regularly, but I'm really liking this most recent layout:

{{< figure src="/img/2022/20220206-Journal.jpg" caption="<span class=\"figure-number\">Figure 1: </span>Paper Journal" >}}

I'm feeling a little bored, and after a Hugo hiccup this morning I'm looking longingly at [my wiki](https://rudimentarylathe.wiki). Don't be surprised if some daily posts show up there instead.
