☁️   Overcast +17°F

Good morning. It's 6:30 am and I've been up since 3:30. I'm hungry.

The problem is that just putting the SL2-S in the box makes me want to keep it. Still for sale, though.

I continue to enjoy Leica's M cameras because they are wildly uncomplicated. Unlike everything else:

People who have a strong aptitude for geeky features and endless complexity simply don't see why they should be denied every possible option. And people who don't like endless features and complexity are <em>shamed</em>, in a sense, into accepting what the geeks are happy with, the assumption being that if they don't learn all the ins-and-outs of their cameras then it's <em>their own fault</em>.
