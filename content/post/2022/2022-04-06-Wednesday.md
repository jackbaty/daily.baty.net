Today, I shall <mark>improve something</mark>. It doesn't matter what that something is.

I am considering some form of <mark>internet hiatus</mark>. Social media, mainly. We all suspect it's not healthy, but I'm still addicted and feel like a break would do me good. Can I manage to only post on the blogs and only read my (fairly limited) set of RSS feeds? Is that enough?

How many of the super-cool things I can do with Org mode are actually useful and not just super-cool things that I think are super-cool?
