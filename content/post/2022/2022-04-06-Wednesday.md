Today, I shall <mark>improve something</mark>. It doesn't matter what that something is.

I am considering some form of <mark>internet hiatus</mark>. Social media, mainly. We all suspect it's not healthy, but I'm still addicted and feel like a break would do me good. Can I manage to only post on the blogs and only read my (fairly limited) set of RSS feeds? Is that enough?

How many of the super-cool things I can do with Org mode are actually useful and not just super-cool things that I think are super-cool?

I wonder if this is related to the USB ports not working on my LG display? [Users Report External Monitor Issues After Updating to macOS Monterey 12.3 - MacRumors](https://www.macrumors.com/2022/03/24/external-display-issues-reported-macos-12-3/). I don't think so. I unplugged the monitor and plugged it back in and it all works again :).

[Mowglii - Itsycal for Mac](https://www.mowglii.com/itsycal/) - Tiny menu bar calendar. Similar to [Dato](https://sindresorhus.com/dato)

Great, I thought I'd try <mark>PhotoPrism on the Synology</mark> so I installed it, pointed it at a few thousand photos, and now it took down the whole synology by chewing through all its memory. Nice.
