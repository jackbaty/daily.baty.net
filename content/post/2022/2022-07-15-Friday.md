I really don't like dealing with WordPress. I copied all recent content from this blog and the baty.net WordPress installation and am hovering over the button to switch DNS for baty.net to the Hugo instance. Wait for it....! **Update** I changed my mind. <mark>Still on WordPress</mark>. This may come back, though. I bailed because after copying recent content over and looking through it, I didn't like how certain images were handled and for the life of me I couldn't figure out how to change it.  And then when proofreading, I noticed that paragraphs of text were too hard to read. It's a font or some other typography issue, but I didn't like it.  It also made me think that my theme is just a little too busy, somehow. Hugo theme changes are non-trivial and can be day-long nightmares. So, I bailed. For now.
