☁️ Overcast +18°F

Alice and I went for our walk at 3:15 am. It's getting ridiculous. I went back to bed when we got home and now it's 6:00 am and that feels much more reasonable. I've been running on five hours sleep a night for a while now and I don't think it's good for me. I'm not 20 years old.
