☁️ Overcast +18°F

Alice and I went for our walk at 3:15 am. It's getting ridiculous. I went back to bed when we got home and now it's 6:00 am and that feels much more reasonable. I've been running on five hours sleep a night for a while now and I don't think it's good for me. I'm not 20 years old.

Interesting new Emacs package: [nobiot/org-remark: Highlight and annotate any text file with using Org mode](https://github.com/nobiot/org-remark)

I can't believe I _still_ have to look up how to remove a git submodule every time:

```sh
git submodule deinit -f themes/daily-jane
rm -rf .git/modules/themes/daily-jane/
git rm -f themes/daily-jane/
```

Listening to music on Linux. The opposite of using [Roon](https://roonlabs.com):

A week or so ago I &lt;mark&gt;removed the analytics&lt;/mark&gt; (Plausible.io) script from this site and, to my amazement, I don't miss it. I didn't expect that. I've never been obsessed with site views/stats. Curious, but not obsessed. Now I'm not even that curious. However, I do like to keep an eye on overall traffic and things like 404s, so I've re-installed [GoAccess](https://goaccess.io/) on the server so I can pop in as needed and review. GoAccess processes the server logs directly, so no need for embedded/tracking scripts.
