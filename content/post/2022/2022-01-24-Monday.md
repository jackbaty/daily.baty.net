☁️ Overcast +18°F

Alice and I went for our walk at 3:15 am. It's getting ridiculous. I went back to bed when we got home and now it's 6:00 am and that feels much more reasonable. I've been running on five hours sleep a night for a while now and I don't think it's good for me. I'm not 20 years old.

Interesting new Emacs package: [nobiot/org-remark: Highlight and annotate any text file with using Org mode](https://github.com/nobiot/org-remark)

I can't believe I _still_ have to look up how to remove a git submodule every time:

```sh
git submodule deinit -f themes/daily-jane
rm -rf .git/modules/themes/daily-jane/
git rm -f themes/daily-jane/
```
