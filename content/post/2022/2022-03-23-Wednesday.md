My tendency to write daily posts <mark>here vs the wiki</mark> is tied to how deep I am into Emacs at the moment. Right now... that's _very deep_.

I've spent hours configuring my [Org-roam](https://www.orgroam.com) setup so I can <mark>publish certain notes as a website</mark>. It's so cool, but in the end I'm not sure it offers clear advantages over this wiki other than that I can make some of my roam notes public without needing to rewrite them in TiddlyWiki. WIP is here: notes.baty.net

Apparently I have too much time on my hands.
