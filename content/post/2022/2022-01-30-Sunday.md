☁️   Overcast +16°F

Great, this website and <https://rudimentarylathe.wiki>  were affected by the recent [mass-revocation by Let's Encrypt](https://threatit.com/articles/lets-encrypt-revokes-2-million-certificates/). I needed to delete the existing certificates and force Caddy to renew them. (They live in `/var/lib/caddy/.local/share`). Sorry for the interruption. I'm not sure why I didn't receive the email from them warning me to renew ahead of time.
