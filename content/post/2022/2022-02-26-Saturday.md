☁️   Overcast +22°F

It's cool that I [consolidated a bunch of blogs](https://baty.net/2022/domain-consolidation-continued/) and reorganized my domain names. That meant I could be down to just a couple (few?) sites. Except I don't enjoy writing in TiddlyWiki nearly as much as I do in Emacs. And this blog looks a lot better than [the wiki](https://rl.baty.net), so I switched. More in [this post](https://baty.net/2022/the-daily-notes-dilemma/) .

I'm going to try setting up the [Focomat IIc](https://rl.baty.net/#Leitz%20Focomat%20IIc) today. It's been in storage for a couple of years. I never did get the longer lens mounted properly, so it's 35mm only for now. I'm hoping I can fit both the IIc and the V35 in at the same time. I'd like to do some side-by-side (condensor vs diffusor head) comparisons. And then eventually figure out the problem with the longer lens so I can also make prints from the Hasselblad (6x6) negatives.

This looks nice for timelines: [kochrt/cascade.page: Make a cascading timeline from markdown-like text.](https://github.com/kochrt/cascade.page)

Half-way into the season and I sti  ll don't give a shit about Boba Fett. It's cool seeing Tatooine, though.
