☁️   Overcast +22°F

It's cool that I [consolidated a bunch of blogs](https://baty.net/2022/domain-consolidation-continued/) and reorganized my domain names. That meant I could be down to just a couple sites (or as we used to say, "a couple-tree"). Except I don't enjoy writing in TiddlyWiki nearly as much as I do in Emacs. And this blog looks a lot better than [the wiki](https://rl.baty.net). It's possible this will remain viable and move to a different domain (probably [daily.baty.net](https://daily.baty.net)).
