☁️   Overcast +22°F

It's cool that I [consolidated a bunch of blogs](https://baty.net/2022/domain-consolidation-continued/) and reorganized my domain names. That meant I could be down to just a couple (few?) sites. Except I don't enjoy writing in TiddlyWiki nearly as much as I do in Emacs. And this blog looks a lot better than [the wiki](https://rl.baty.net). It's possible this will remain viable and move to a different domain (probably [daily.baty.net](https://daily.baty.net)). More in [this post](https://baty.net/2022/the-daily-notes-dilemma/) .
