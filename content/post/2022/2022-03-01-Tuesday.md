Hooboy, it's March.

Looking at the server analytics (I use [GoAccess - Visual Web Log Analyzer](https://goaccess.io/)) for this site shows that a large majority of "hits" are to the RSS feed. This makes me feel a little bad about posting so much over on [the wiki](https://wiki.baty.net). I know I keep saying that my daily notes are "for me" but that guilt I feel makes me think otherwise.

Oh cool, I posted on [my Tumblr](https://jackbaty.tumblr.com) this morning.
