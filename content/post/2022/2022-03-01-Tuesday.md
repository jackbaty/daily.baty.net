Hooboy, it's March.

Looking at the server analytics (I use [GoAccess - Visual Web Log Analyzer](https://goaccess.io/)) for this site shows that a large majority of "hits" are to the RSS feed. This makes me feel a little bad about posting so much over on [the wiki](https://wiki.baty.net). I know I keep saying that my daily notes are "for me" but that guilt I feel makes me think otherwise.

Oh cool, I posted on [my Tumblr](https://jackbaty.tumblr.com) this morning.

I put a roll through the IIIC. It was fun. It's a nice lens.

My subscription to [Reid Reviews](https://www.reidreviews.com) has expired. I'm off subscriptions right now so I'm not going to renew yet. It's a great resource, but focuses so much on the micro-differences between lenses and sensors and I'm not really interested in that lately.

Am I thinking about Ukraine? Of course I'm thinking about Ukraine. I'm terrified.
