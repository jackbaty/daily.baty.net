⛅️  Partly cloudy +16°F

Good morning. It's 4:03 am and I'm already finished walking with Alice. I don't make coffee until 5:00 am so I've got an hour of nothing to do but chat with all of you. Hi! 👋.

I don't understand the need for "writing prompts". Unless writing is your job, or you're working on a book, if you don't feel like writing, maybe just don't write and stop worrying about it?
