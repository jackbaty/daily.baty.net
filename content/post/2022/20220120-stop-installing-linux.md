Spending half my day yesterday installing [Regolith Linux](https://regolith-linux.org) on an old ThinkPad was fun, but useless. I should stop wasting my time like that.

For a time, I thought I'd stick with my Mac on the desktop and use Linux for my portable workstation. Linux is fun to tinker with. There are dozens of variations try. It's got the right philosophy about how things should work and how computing should _be_. I like having it around, but I don't like _using_ it so much.

For years I've used a desktop Mac and a MacBook. Weary of dealing with maintaining two machines and worrying about sync, configuration, etc., I recently consolidated my computers down to one Mac. It's so much better having only one machine. I now realize just how much time I'd spent managing everything. It was _a lot_. Moving to a single-computer setup has been the most productive and satisfying change I've made in years.

And yet there I was, installing Regolith because Paul Ford mentioned it on Twitter.

I know no one cares but Regolith on Ubuntu + nord theme is a nice way to do a tiling window manager without plowing through a pile of Arch wiki pages where no one will tell you the default modifier key because you should set that yourself.

That's all it took. I thought, "Hey, that looks neat, I should throw it on the old ThinkPad!" So I did. And Paul was right. It was nice.

I'm infatuated with tiling window managers, and Regolith takes a neat approach to merging [i3](https://i3wm.org) and "regular" Ubuntu. I plugged it into my 32" monitor, where a window manager shines. I thought, "I could learn to live like this."

But, after a few hours, all of the little inconsistencies begin to show. I start to miss the little quality-of-life touches that I take for granted on macOS. I once again need to concern myself with sync. And oh, the new MacBook Pro M1 Pro Max is a glorious piece of hardware (and software). Unmatched, as far as I know.

One day I may go all-in on Linux. That's the only way it could work for me. That day is not today, so I need to stop spending too much time thinking it might be.
