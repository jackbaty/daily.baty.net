My favorite recent system change has been naming files using <mark>CamelCase for filenames</mark>. snake_case was the worst, but using-hypens-wasn't-much-better. The easiest combination of typing ease and readability is CamelCase. So from now on it's PhotoOfMyDog.jpg. OK that's not true since I also prefix most files with a datestamp. How about 20220205-PhotoOfMyDog.jpg. Keyboard Maestro handles the YYYYMMDD- part so it's not has painful to type as it looks.
