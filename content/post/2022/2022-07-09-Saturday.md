I think it's time for YouTubers to <mark>calm down with the production values</mark>. I never trust a video that looks too good.

One thing I've noticed when using TheBrain is the tendency to <mark>get lost in the links</mark>. I become lost in thoughts, as it were. I find this to be both a blessing and curse for someone as easily distracted as me.

Fun fact about me: I almost always cry in museums.

Someone recently added me to a Twitter list named "Miscellaneous" and nothing could be more appropriate.
