☁️   Overcast +5°F

I plugged in the Mac yesterday so I could actually enjoy working with photos. What I'm finding is that I, again, miss using i3 and workspaces the way they're set up in Regolith. I've been trying some combinations of Rectangle and Divvy and Better Touch Tool to see what I can get, but nothing works as smoothly and consistently. I'm about to plug in the ThinkPad for the day. Weird.
