I've been thinking about killing Roon and moving to Apple Music. But I have a lifetime license to Roon, so that's weird. The trouble is that Roon doesn't work for me unless it's also connected to Qobuz, which costs me $15/month.

Currently, I pay for Qobuz, Spotify, and Apple Music. That's nuts. Qobuz is fine, but it's no longer the only decent Hi-Res option in town. I've never liked Spotify, but I have family that lives there. I have an Apple One family account, so I'm already paying for everyone to have Music.

Apple Music is not a great app and it's not the smartest streaming service, but I get it with the rest of the Apple One subscription, so that's where I'm headed.

I'm just going to have to bite the bullet and wean everyone from Spotify. And I'm going to have to wean myself from the wonders of Roon, for streaming, at least. Roon still works great with my local music library.

So, I'm not actually leaving Roon. I'm leaving Qobuz, but the effect will be similar.
