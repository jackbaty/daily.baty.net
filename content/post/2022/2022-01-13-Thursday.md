Logseq is for those who don't know Emacs. Hell, just about _everything_ is for people who don't know Emacs.

I'm afraid to commit to anything because what if I end up wasting my life on it? So instead, I waste my life doing nothing.

Spending a bit of time in the darkroom today. I caught up on my contact sheets so far. There was a roll of Fuji Superia in the Nikon F-100 so I fired off a bunch of flash shots to finish the roll. I'm going to process it in my old C-41 chemistry and hope for the best because I don't want to mix up a fresh batch.
