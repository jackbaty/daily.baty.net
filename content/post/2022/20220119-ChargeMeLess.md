I would like pricing pressure for software to go up, but for subscriptions to go down. I'll happily pay $250 for a great app, but don't want to pay more than $12/year for a read-it-later service or newsletter or magazine. The number of apps I need is rather low. The number services, news, and entertainment options I need approaches infinity and I just don't have the budget for that.
