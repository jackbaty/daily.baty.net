☀️   Clear +20°F

The fact that I often cannot tell the <mark>difference between someone being smart</mark> and someone trying to sound smart gives you an idea of how smart I am.

I'm now running both [Alfred](https://alfredapp.com) and [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com) at the same time. I'm using Raycast for launching, clipboards, etc. and keeping Alfred running for a couple of workflows and "Universal Actions". Why not?
