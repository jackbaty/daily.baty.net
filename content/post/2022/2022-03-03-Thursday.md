☀️   Clear +20°F

The fact that I often cannot tell the <mark>difference between someone being smart</mark> and someone trying to sound smart gives you an idea of how smart I am.

I'm now running both [Alfred](https://alfredapp.com) and [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com) at the same time. I'm using Raycast for launching, clipboards, etc. and keeping Alfred running for a couple of workflows and "Universal Actions". Why not? Although I may decide to reverse their roles at some point.

**Monday**: Ima use TiddlyWiki for everything! <br />
**Tuesday**: Logseq! I need to put everything into Logseq! <br />
**Wednesday**: What was I thinking? Emacs is life! <br />
**Thursday**: ???

One nice feature of using Hugo for this site is that I <mark>haven't felt a need to futz with it</mark> in a while. I just write, save, and type "make deploy".

I love having a big screen, but <mark>hate managing windows</mark>. I can't help but be distracted by background windows so I either fart around moving things to spaces or I hide them. As a test, I'm trying Hazeover ([HazeOver: Distraction Dimmer™ for Productivity on Mac](https://hazeover.com/)) to see if just auto-dimming the unfocused windows will help.
