☁️   Overcast +22°F

I spent yesterday over at [the wiki](https://rudimentarylathe.wiki) because I missed how easy it is to post there and how it tied all of my thoughts together so nicely. But, <mark>who wants to write in a little HTML text area</mark> in a browser all day when I could be in Emacs using Org mode with Vim bindings. Plus, here I have an RSS feed, better archives, and it _looks_ better, IMO. One problem is that with this blog it feels like I'm just throwing everything onto a pile, where in TiddlyWiki it feels organized and linked up nicely right out of the box. The dilemma remains.

Why do people assume that whatever "early" humans did was somehow more "natural" than what we do today? More likely it was the only option and they'd kill to have what we have and would do it our way in a heartbeat. And they'd be better for it.
