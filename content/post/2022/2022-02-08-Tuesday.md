☁️   Overcast +22°F

I spent yesterday over at [the wiki](https://rudimentarylathe.wiki) because I missed how easy it is to post there and how it tied all of my thoughts together so nicely. But, <mark>who wants to write in a little HTML text area</mark> in a browser all day when I could be in Emacs using Org mode with Vim bindings. Plus, here I have an RSS feed, better archives, and it _looks_ better, IMO. The dilemma remains.
