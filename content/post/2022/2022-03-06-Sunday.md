WordPress is fine. Medium is fine. Facebook is fine. Twitter is fine. Mastodon is fine. Your self-hosted static-HTML website is fine. Instagram is fine. A typewriter in your basement is fine. <mark>Write wherever you feel like writing</mark>. Me? I like writing everywhere. Today, I'm here. Or perhaps more precisely, _this morning_, I'm here.

There's nothing like <mark>an open Emacs frame</mark> narrowed to today's post here. I write, save, export, and done. Repeat as needed throughout the day.

One day, if I'm lucky, I'll be busy actually _doing something_ and won't have time to write here all day.
