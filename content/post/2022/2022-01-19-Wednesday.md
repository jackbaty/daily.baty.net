☁️   Overcast +41°F

Good morning. It's 4:50 am and I'm probably going to install [Regolith](https://regolith-linux.org) today on the old ThinkPad. I swore I was done tinkering with Linux but ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯.

I've had to remove my plausible.io analytics scripts due to very slow loading.

I'm writing this using Emacs in a fresh Regolith install runnin on my old ThinkPad. About to try a deployment from here as well. If you can read this, I've successfully wasted an entire morning.
